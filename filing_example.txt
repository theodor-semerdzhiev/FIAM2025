--- RISK FACTORS ---

Item 7B Risk Factors.................................................................... 24 ITEM 7B - RISK FACTORS

 You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to
other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report before
investing in our securities. Realization of any of the following risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows
and results of operations.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS

WE HAVE GENERATED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN RECENT PERIODS.

 We incurred significant net losses during the three years prior to 2004. In
2004, we reported net income of 58.4 million, but we reported net losses of
 232.2 million, 56.2 million and 57.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Our ability to achieve and sustain
profitability in the future will depend on the successful continued
implementation of measures to reduce costs and achieve sales goals, as well as
the ability to pass on to customers increases in raw materials and components.
While we have taken steps to lower operating costs and reduce interest expense,
and have seen our sales improve in recent periods, we cannot assure you that our
cost-reduction measures will be successful, sales will be sustained or increased
or that we will achieve a sustained return to profitability.

OUR INVENTORIES ARE NOT MANAGED BY PERPETUAL INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEMS.

 The systems and processes we use to manage and value our inventories
require significant manual intervention and the verification of actual
quantities requires physical inventories, which we take several times a year.
Breakdowns of these systems and processes, and errors in inventory estimates
derived from these systems and processes, could go undetected until the next
physical inventory and adversely affect our operations and financial results.

AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF
OUR CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

 We have relationships with a number of customers where we supply the
requirements of these customers. We do not have binding agreements with these
customers. Our success is dependent, to a significant extent, upon the continued
strength of these relationships and the growth of our core customers. We often
are unable to predict the level of demand for our products from these customers,
or the timing of their orders. In addition, the same economic conditions that
adversely affect us also often adversely affect our customers. As some of our
customers are highly leveraged and have limited access to capital, their
continued existence may be uncertain. One of our customers, Grupo Transportation
Marititma Mexicana SA (TMM), which is located in Mexico, has been experiencing
financial difficulties even though it restructured its debt in August 2004, and
is in the process of selling certain of its assets. Payments from TMM to us are
currently behind schedule. The customer owes us 7.3 million as of December 31,
2004 secured by highly specialized RoadRailer(R) equipment, which due to the
nature of the equipment, has a minimal recovery value. The loss of a significant
customer or unexpected delays in product purchases could adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS MAY NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WHICH COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

 We continue to introduce new products, such as the DuraPlateHD(R) and the
Freight-Pro(R) trailer. We cannot assure you that these or other new products or
technologies will achieve sustained market acceptance. In addition, new
technologies or products that our competitors introduce may render our products
obsolete or uncompetitive. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights
in our new products. However, the steps we have taken to protect them may not be
sufficient or may not be enforced by a court of law. If we are unable to protect
our proprietary rights, other parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or
use our products or technology. If competitors are able to use our technology,
our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.

24
 
WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OF RAW MATERIALS; AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE
OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key
components in the manufacturing of truck trailers, such as tires, landing gear,
axles and specialty steel coil used in DuraPlate(R) panels. From time to time,
there have been and may in the future continue to be shortages of supplies of
raw materials or our suppliers may place us on allocation, which would have an
adverse impact on our ability to meet demand for our products. Raw material
shortages and allocations may result in inefficient operations and a build-up of
inventory, which can negatively affect our working capital position. In
addition, if the price of raw materials were to increase and we were unable to
increase our selling prices or reduce our operating costs to offset the price
increases, our operating margins would be adversely affected. The loss of any of
our suppliers or their inability to meet our price, quality, quantity and
delivery requirements could have a significant impact on our results of
operations.

DISRUPTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

 We manufacture our products at two trailer manufacturing facilities in
Lafayette, Indiana, and one hardwood floor facility in Harrison, Arkansas. Our
primary manufacturing facility accounts for approximately 85 of our
manufacturing output. An unexpected disruption in our production at either of
these facilities or in our management information systems for any length of time
would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 Many of our executive officers, including our CEO William P. Greubel and
COO Richard J. Giromini, are critical to the management and direction of our
business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain
these officers and other capable management personnel. The unexpected loss of
the services of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on the
operation of our business, as we may be unable to find suitable management to
replace departing executives on a timely basis.

THE INABILITY TO REALIZE ADDITIONAL COSTS SAVINGS COULD WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE
POSITION.

 If we are unable to continue to successfully implement our program of cost
reduction and continuous improvement, we may not realize additional anticipated
cost savings, which could weaken our competitive position.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

 We are subject to currency exchange rate risk related to sales through our
factory-owned retail distribution centers in Canada. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable
impact of 0.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively, on our results of
operations. We cannot assure you that future currency exchange rate fluctuations
will not have an adverse affect on our results of operations.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS COULD LIMIT OUR FINANCIAL AND
OPERATING FLEXIBILITY AND SUBJECT US TO OTHER RISKS.

 The agreements governing our indebtedness include certain covenants that
restrict, among other things, our ability to:

 - incur additional debt;

 - pay dividends on our common stock in excess of 10 million per year;

 - repurchase our common stock;

 - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;

25
 
 - make certain investments, mergers and acquisitions; and

 - create certain liens.

 Additionally, should our available borrowing capacity drop below 40
million, we would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which
could limit our ability to make capital expenditures and further limit the
amount of dividends we could pay.

 Our ability to comply with such agreements may be affected by events beyond
our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.
In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt
agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our
debt agreements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and
payable.

RISKS PARTICULAR TO THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE

OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 The truck trailer manufacturing industry historically has been and is
expected to continue to be cyclical, as well as affected by overall economic
conditions. New trailer production for the trailer industry reached its most
recent peak of approximately 306,000 units in 1999, falling to approximately
140,000 by 2001 and rebounding to approximately 229,000 units in 2004. Customers
historically have replaced trailers in cycles that run from five to twelve
years, depending on service and trailer type. Poor economic conditions can
adversely affect demand for new trailers and in the past have led to an overall
aging of trailer fleets beyond this typical replacement cycle. Customers' buying
patterns can also reflect regulatory changes, such as the new federal
hours-of-service rules and anticipated 2007 federal emissions standards. Our
business is likely to continue to be highly cyclical based on current and
expected economic conditions and regulatory factors.

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY RESULT IN OUR
COMPETITORS OFFERING NEW OR BETTER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR LOWER PRICES, WHICH
COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND A DECREASE IN OUR REVENUES.

 The truck trailer manufacturing industry is highly competitive. We compete
with other manufacturers of varying sizes, some of which may have greater
financial resources than we do. Barriers to entry in the standard truck trailer
manufacturing industry are low. As a result, it is possible that additional
competitors could enter the market at any time. In the recent past, the
manufacturing over-capacity and high leverage of some of our competitors, along
with the bankruptcies and financial stresses that affected the industry,
contributed to significant pricing pressures.

 If we are unable to compete successfully with other trailer manufacturers,
we could lose customers and our revenues may decline. In addition, competitive
pressures in the industry may affect the market prices of our new and used
equipment, which, in turn, may adversely affect our sales margins and results of
operations.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR COSTS
RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH, OR OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, EXISTING OR FUTURE
LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

 The length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications
of truck trailers are regulated by individual states. The Federal government
also regulates certain truck trailer safety features, such as lamps, reflective
devices, tires, air-brake systems and rear-impact guards. Changes or
anticipation of changes in these regulations can have a material impact on our
financial results, as our customers may defer purchasing decisions and we may
have to reengineer products. In addition, we are subject to various
environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation, storage,
presence, use, disposal and handling of hazardous materials, discharge of storm
water and underground fuel storage tanks and may be subject to liability
associated with operations of prior owners of acquired property. In 2004, we
paid 0.4 million and agreed to a compliance agreement with the EPA related to
violations of the federal Clean Water Act at our former Huntsville, Tennessee
manufacturing facility.

 If we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations in the
future, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Our costs of complying with these or any other current or
future environmental regulations may be significant. In addition, if we fail to
comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to
governmental or judicial fines or sanctions.

26
 
A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF USED TRAILERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

 General economic and industry conditions, as well as the supply of used
trailers, influence the value of used trailers. As part of our normal business
practices, we maintain used trailer inventories and have entered into finance
contracts secured by used trailers, as well as residual guarantees and purchase
commitments for used trailers. Declines in the market value for used trailers or
the need to dispose of excess inventories has had, and could in the future have,
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS.

 As a manufacturer of products widely used in commerce, we are subject to
regular product liability claims as well as warranty and similar claims alleging
defective products. From time to time claims may involve material amounts and
novel legal theories, and any insurance we carry may prove inadequate to
insulate us from material liabilities for these claims.

RISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK

OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, PRICE
VOLATILITY AND A LOW TRADING VOLUME.

 The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be
subject to large fluctuations. Our common stock price may increase or decrease
in response to a number of events and factors, including:

 - trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate;

 - changes in the market price of the products we sell;

 - the introduction of new technologies or products by us or our
 competitors;

 - changes in expectations as to our future financial performance,
 including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;

 - operating results that vary from the expectations of securities
 analysts and investors;

 - announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,
 acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, financings or
 capital commitments;

 - changes in laws and regulations; and

 - general economic and competitive conditions.

 This volatility may adversely affect the prices of our common stock
regardless of our operating performance. The price of our common stock also may
be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of
our 3 1/4 convertible senior notes due 2008. Assuming 125 million in aggregate
principal amount of these notes are converted at a conversion price of 19.20,
the number of shares of our common stock outstanding would increase by 6.5
million, or approximately 21 . The conversion feature of our 3 1/4 convertible
senior notes is subject to adjustment in connection with the payment of cash
dividends. As a result of any future payment of a cash dividend, upon any
conversion of the notes we would be required to issue additional shares of
common stock.

 In addition, our common stock has experienced low trading volume in the
past.

--- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) ---

Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
 Operations................................................................... 12 ITEM 7--MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
 OF OPERATIONS

 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations ("MD&A") describes the matters that we consider to be
important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and our capital resources and
liquidity as of December 31, 2004. Our discussion begins with our assessment of
the condition of the North American trailer industry along with a summary of the
actions we have taken to reposition Wabash. We then analyze the results of our
operations for the last three years, including the trends in the overall
business and our operations segments, followed by a discussion of our cash flows
and liquidity, capital markets events and transactions, our new credit facility,
and contractual commitments. We then provide a review of the critical accounting
judgments and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to
an understanding of our MD&A and our consolidated financial statements. These
are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement
of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements.
We conclude our MD&A with information on recent accounting

12
 
pronouncements which we adopted during the year, as well as those not yet
adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting
practices.

 We have two reportable segments: manufacturing and retail and distribution.
The manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who
purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and
distribution segment. The retail and distribution segment includes the sale of
new and used trailers, as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service
through its retail branch network.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 The year 2004 marks the second year of recovery for the industry after a
three-year downturn. During this period, we repositioned Wabash by focusing
on the continuous improvement of our manufacturing and retail operations,
expanding our customer base, introducing products that better address customers
needs, exiting non-core operations and strengthening our capital structure. We
believe Wabash is positioned to fully participate in the market growth that
analysts are predicting will continue into 2005 and beyond.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE

 We measure our operating performance in four key areas - Safety, Quality,
Productivity and Cost Reduction. Our objective, be better tomorrow than we are
today, is simple, straightforward and easily understood by all our associates.

 - Safety. We have achieved a four-fold improvement in the total
 recordable incident rate since June 2002, and our safety metrics have
 improved each quarter for 10 straight quarters. We believe improved
 safety translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a
 result of less time missed due to injuries.

 - Quality. We measure our quality performance in terms of:

 - First pass yield: How many units pass all inspection criteria
 without requiring rework? Our first pass yield metrics have
 improved from 20 in 2002 to 95 during 2004.

 - Warranty: We measure, among other things, the number and severity
 of warranty claims. While improvements are being noted and we are
 encouraged by the results, a longer term perspective is required
 before declaring success.

 - Productivity. We measure productivity on many fronts. Some key
 indicators include production line speed, man-hours per trailer and
 inventory levels. Improvements in these areas translate into:

 - Increased available capacity, which we estimated to be over
 75,000 units annually based on a three-shift, five-day work week.

 - Effective management of inventory has resulted in inventory turns
 of currently 10 turns per year compared to approximately six
 turns in 2002.

 - Cost Reduction. During 2002, we introduced our continuous improvement
 initiative (CI). As of December 2004, we believe CI has become a way
 of life. Since introduction, over 300 CI events have been completed.

 As a result of our focus in these areas, we received the 2003 U.S. Senate
Productivity Award for the State of Indiana for the significant cost savings and
productivity we achieved in the prior two years.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

 Freight transportation in the United States, according to the American
Trucking Association (ATA), was estimated to be a 702 billion industry in 2003
(the latest such information is available). ATA estimates that approximately 69 
of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment,
accounting for approximately 87 of freight industry revenue in the United
States. Trailer demand is a direct function of the

13
 
amount of freight to be transported. To monitor the state of the industry, we
evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the
transportation industry. Information is obtained from sources such as A.C.T.
Research Co., LLC (ACT), ATA, Cass Logistics, and Eno Transportation Foundation.
Recent trends we have observed include the following:

 - IMPROVEMENT IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS SHIPPED. After reaching a high
 of approximately 306,000 units shipped in 1999, shipments by the
 U.S. trailer industry declined to approximately 140,000 units in
 each of 2001 and 2002. Unit shipments improved to approximately
 174,000 units in 2003 and were approximately 229,000 in 2004. ACT
 estimates that 2005 shipments will be approximately 271,000
 units. Our view is that shipments will be approximately 5 to 10 
 lower than the ACT forecast due to the impact of raw material
 costs on trailer prices and tractor purchases in advance of new
 emission regulations.

 - INCREASING AGE OF TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER TRAILER FLEETS. During
 the three-year period ending December 31, 2003, (the latest
 such information is available) the average age of trailer fleets
 increased from approximately 44 months to 55 months. We believe
 this increase resulted in part from deferred purchases by many
 motor carriers. This trend suggests to us that there may be
 pent-up replacement demand for trailers.

 - INCREASING RATE OF NEW TRAILER ORDERS. Quarterly industry order
 placements were in the range of 10,000 units to 15,000 units per
 month during each of the six quarters ended December 31, 2003.
 During 2004, the total trailer quarterly average order rates
 ranged from 18,500 to 26,000 units. The fourth quarter of 2004
 order rate average of 26,000 units was the strongest quarterly
 average order rate since 1999.

 - OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. Other developments and our view of their
 potential impact on the industry include:

 - New federal emission standards that come into effect in 2007
 could result in improved demand for trailers in 2005 and
 part of 2006, as motor carriers may focus their capital
 spending on tractors in advance of the regulations taking
 effect. A similar pattern occurred in advance of the October
 2002 enactment of new emission standards.

 - Technology advances in trailer tracking and route management
 implemented by motor carriers have increased trailer
 utilization and lowered trailer-to-tractor ratios and could
 result in trailer demand.

 - New federal hours-of-service rules became effective in
 January 2004. We initially believed that these rules would
 negatively impact driver productivity and that this could
 result in increased demand for trailers. As a result of
 Court intervention, on September 30, 2004, President Bush
 signed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2004,
 allowing these regulations to remain in effect until the
 earlier of a new regulation that resolves Court-raised
 issues or September 30, 2005. To date, we believe that there
 has been a limited amount of increased business as a result
 of the regulation. If the regulation is permanently
 suspended, there is the potential for cancellation of
 refrigerated units and some increase of trade-ins that could
 affect used trailer prices.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 The following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of
net sales for the periods indicated:

2004 COMPARED TO 2003

NET SALES

 Net sales in 2004 increased 153.2 million compared to the 2003 period. The
2003 year included 58.9 million of sales associated with our rental and leasing
and aftermarket parts distribution businesses (Asset Sales). By business
segment, net sales to external customers and related units sold were as follows
(in millions):

Year Ended December 31,
 -----------------------------
 2004 2003 Change
 -------- ------- --------
 
Net Sales by segment:
 Manufacturing 806.0 620.1 30 
 Retail and Distribution 235.1 267.8 (12 -------- -------
Total 1,041.1 887.9 17 

New trailer units:

 Retail and Distribution 6,100 4,100 49 
 -------- -------
Total 51,200 41,000 25 

Used trailer units 6,900 11,700 (41 

 Improving conditions in both the overall economy and the transportation
industry coupled with the expansion of our customer base, drove a 22 increase
in unit volume in the manufacturing segment. In response to significant
increases in raw material prices, we increased our average selling price
throughout the year. In the fourth quarter of 2004, our average selling price
increased approximately 10 compared to the 2003 period with the full year
increase being approximately 6 .

15
 
 The 2004 sales in the retail and distribution segment were lower than the
prior year period, which included 58.9 million of sales associated with the
aforementioned Assets Sales. A 44.2 million increase in new trailer sales
caused by a 49 increase in units was partially offset by reductions in used
trailer sales. The decrease in used trailer sales resulted from constrained used
equipment availability, as transportation companies retain equipment to meet
requirements. Branch parts and services sales were up approximately 3 despite
closing four full service locations in 2003 and one during 2004.

GROSS PROFIT

 Gross profit as a percent of sales was 12.1 in 2004 compared to 5.9 in
2003, which included a 28.5 million asset impairment charge taken on certain
assets of our rental and leasing and aftermarket parts assets. As discussed
below, both of our segments contributed as follows (in millions):

Years Ended December 31,
 -------------------------
 2004 2003 Change
 ------ ----- --------
 
Gross Profit (loss) by segment:
 Manufacturing 110.8 61.3 49.5
 Retail and Distribution 16.8 (9.2) 26.0
 Eliminations (1.8) 0.4 (2.2)
 ------ ----- -----
Total Gross Profit 125.8 52.5 73.3

The manufacturing segment's gross profit as a percentage of sales was 13.7 
in 2004, a 3.8 percentage point increase from the prior year period. During
2004, due to increases in our key raw materials - principally steel and wood,
our average per trailer raw material costs, including the effects of product mix
increased approximately 9.7 from the prior period, which exceeded increases in
our average selling price resulting in a negative impact on gross profit of 6.5
million. The shortfall from rising material costs was more than offset by the
continued improvement in our labor and overhead utilization of 32.3 million,
the impact of higher volumes of 21.3 million and a reduction in warranty
expense of 1.4 million.

 The 2004 gross profit in the retail and distribution segment improved 26.0
million from the prior year. The 2003 period included a 28.5 million asset
impairment charge and 10.3 million of gross profit associated with the Asset
Sales. Gross profit in 2004 was positively impacted by higher new trailer
volumes and margins and improved used trailer margins, offset by continued
constraints on used trailer volumes. The 2004 period includes 1.1 million of
profit related to the sale of used RoadRailer(R) bogies.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

 General and administrative expenses for 2004 of 41.6 million were flat
compared to the prior year. The 2004 period included 2.3 million in increased
technology costs and 1.0 million in charges related to legal settlements. The
2003 period included 2.6 million in debt refinancing costs, 2.0 million in
costs from operations affected by the Asset Sales and 0.9 million related to
branch closings.

SELLING EXPENSE

 Selling expense decreased 4.9 million to 15.0 million in 2004, compared
to 19.9 million in the prior year period due to the impact of the Asset Sales
and the closing of 12 branch locations during 2003.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

 Interest expense totaled 10.8 million in 2004; a decrease of 20.4 million
from the prior year period due to lower effective interest rates resulting from
the debt refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2003 and reduced average
borrowings.

 Foreign exchange was a gain of 0.5 million in 2004 and a gain of 5.3
million in 2003, which reflected the significant weakening of the US dollar
relative to the Canadian dollar in 2003.

16
 
 Loss on debt extinguishment was 19.8 million in 2003 and 0.6 million in
2004. The 2003 loss represents the additional costs associated with the early
extinguishment of the Company's Senior Series Notes and Bank Debt. The 2004 loss
represents the write-off of deferred debt costs associated with the pay-off of
our Bank Term Loan in the fourth quarter with proceeds from the common stock
issuance.

 Other, net was income of 0.7 million in 2004, compared to an expense of
 2.5 million for the 2003 period. The 2003 expense included a 3.2 million loss
on the sale of a large portion of our finance portfolio, 1.3 million charge for
the settlement of a legacy RoadRailer(R) transaction and a 0.8 million loss on
the sale of certain assets, offset by gains of 2.9 million on the sale of
closed branch properties.

INCOME TAXES

 In 2004, we recognized income tax expense of 0.6 million primarily related
to Federal and state alternative minimum tax (AMT). The 2004 income tax expense
is significantly below the normal statutory tax rate primarily because of the
utilization of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. No income tax expense or
benefit was recognized in 2003. Because of uncertainty related to the
realizability of NOLs in excess of those utilized, a full valuation allowance
continues to be recorded against deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004.

2003 COMPARED TO 2002

NET SALES

 Net sales improved 8 from 2002. Base upon ACT data, the first quarter of
2002 is believed to have been the low point of the industry downturn that began
in 2000. By business segment, net external sales and related units sold were as
follows (dollars in millions):

Years Ended December 31,
 ----------------------------
 2003 2002 Change
 ------- ------- --------
 
Net Sales by segment:
 Manufacturing 620.1 492.3 26 
 Retail and Distribution 267.8 327.3 (18)

 ------- -------
Total 41,000 34,500 19 
 ======= =======
Used trailer units 11,700 17,600 (34) 
 ======= =======

The manufacturing segment's sales improvement was driven by demand for new
trailers and improved product mix. Average selling price increased 4.7 
primarily due to product mix: for example, we sold approximately 5,000 fewer
lower priced containers and chassis in 2003 compared to 2002.

 The decrease in the retail and distribution segment's net sales reflects:

 - used trailer sales decline of 27.5 million as unit sales fell 34 due
 to completing the disposition of excess inventories during 2002 and
 the impact of closing certain locations;

 - the sale of certain assets of the aftermarket parts distribution
 business and the trailer rental and leasing business in September 2003
 primarily accounts for 27.7 million of the sales decline;

 - branch parts and services sales decline of 8.7 million primarily due

GROSS PROFIT (LOSS)

 Gross profit as a percent of sales was 9.1 for 2003 compared to 5.6 in
2002, before asset impairment charges of 28.5 million and 2.0 million in 2003
and 2002, respectively. The 2003 asset impairment charge was taken on certain
assets of the rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses. A summary of
gross profit by segment follows (in millions):

Years Ended December 31,

Gross Profit (Loss) by segment:
 Manufacturing 61.3 22.2 39.1
 Retail and Distribution (9.2) 21.5 (30.7)
 Eliminations 0.4 0.1 0.3
 ----- ----- ------
Total Gross Profit 52.5 43.8 8.7
 ===== ===== ======

The manufacturing segment's gross profit increased due to higher volumes
and improved product mix, coupled with realizing cost savings driven by our
continuous improvement initiatives. The segment's 2003 gross profit percentage
of 9.9 exceeded the 8.9 attained in 1999, the most recent production cycle
peak.

 The retail and distribution segment's gross profit for 2003 was negatively
impacted by the 28.5 million asset impairment charge and 3.9 million in
trailer valuation charges. Gross profit for 2002 was negatively impacted by 4.8
million in loss contingencies and asset impairment charges related to equipment
held for lease and 5.4 million in used trailer valuation charges. Additionally,
the lower gross profit resulted from lower margins on used trailer sales and the
impact of selling certain assets of the rental and leasing and aftermarket parts
businesses in September 2003. New trailers margins held steady in relation to
2002.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

 General and administrative expenses decreased 16.0 million to 41.6
million for 2003, compared to 57.6 million for the same period in 2002. The
2003 expense included 2.6 million in debt restructuring costs, 0.9 million
related to the branch closings, offset in part by a 0.8 million recovery of VAT
taxes. The 2002 expense included 10.6 million in bad debt expense mainly
related to the finance and leasing businesses, 2.2 million in severance
accruals, 1.9 million in write-downs related to the disposition of our airplane
and 1.2 million in debt restructuring costs.

SELLING EXPENSES

 Selling expenses decreased 3.2 million to 19.9 million in 2003, compared
to 23.1 million in 2002. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of retail
branch closings and the September 2003 sale of certain assets of our trailer
rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

 Interest expense totaled 31.2 million for 2003, a decrease of 3.8 million
from the prior year. Through the first three quarters of 2003, interest expense
exceeded that of 2002 due to higher interest rates and increased amortization of
debt costs resulting from debt restructurings in 2002 and 2003. The debt
refinancing and assets sales during the second half of 2003 resulted in lower
interest rates and average borrowings, respectively.

 Foreign exchange gains and losses, net were gains of 5.3 million for 2003,
primarily occurring in the first six months of the year reflecting a
strengthening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar.

 Loss on debt extinguishment of 19.8 million in 2003 primarily represents
the additional costs associated with the early extinguishment of our then
outstanding debt.

 Other, net for 2003 was a net expense of 2.5 million compared to a net
income of 3.5 million for the same period in 2002. The 2003 period included a
 3.2 million loss on the sale of a large portion of our finance portfolio, 1.3
million charge for the settlement of a legacy RoadRailer(R) transaction and a
 0.8 million loss on the

18
 
sale of certain assets, offset in part by gains of 2.9 million on the sale of
closed branch properties. The 2002 period included gains on the sale of closed
branch properties.

INCOME TAXES

 We recorded no income tax benefit in 2003 due to uncertainties surrounding
the realizability of benefits associated with NOLs. The 2002 benefit recorded
represents an additional realizable federal NOL carry-back claim filed and
received under the provisions of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of
2002, which revised the permitted carry-back period for NOLs generated during
2001 from two years to five years.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CAPITAL STRUCTURE

 Today, our capital structure is comprised of a mix of equity and debt after
overcoming significant losses incurred during the years 2000 through 2003. In
2004, we were able to further solidify our financial footing through improved
operating performance and proceeds from our equity offering, as well as
amendments to our bank debt agreements. These 2004 actions, described below,
resulted in repayment or refinancing of essentially all of our bank debt,
increased our financial flexibility and further reduced the effective rate on
borrowings. Our objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to
satisfy normal requirements for working capital and capital expenditures and be
positioned to take advantage of market opportunities.

Equity Offering

 On November 3, 2004, we completed the issuance of 3,450,000 shares of our
common stock resulting in net proceeds of 75.7 million. With the proceeds from
the issuance, we paid off the remaining balance on our bank term loan of 25.8
million, using the remaining proceeds to pay down borrowings under our bank
revolver, in conjunction with the early pay-off of the bank term loan.

Debt Amendment

 On December 30, 2004, we amended and restated our asset-based loan
agreement (ABL Facility), which we had originally entered into in September
2003. The amended facility is secured by our property, plant and equipment,
inventory and accounts receivable and the amount available to borrow varies in
relation to the balances of those accounts among other things, as defined in the
agreements. As of December 31, 2004, borrowing capacity was 117.6 million with
no debt outstanding. The most notable amendments to the facility included:

 - Reduced the capacity under the ABL Facility from 175 million to 125
 million.

 - Extended the maturity date of the facility from September 30, 2006 to
 September 30, 2007.

 - Eliminated financial covenants and certain other restrictions so long
 as unused availability remains above 40 million.

 - Allowed payment of cash dividends up to 10 million per year.

 - Reduced the borrowing rates and fees.

 Interest on the ABL Facility is variable, based on the London Interbank
Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus 150 basis points or the bank's alternative rate, as
defined in the agreement. At December 31, 2004, the 30-day LIBOR was 2.4 . We
pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility at a rate of 25
points per annum. All interest and fees are paid monthly. For the quarter ended
December 31, 2004, the weighted average interest rate was 4.56 .

Cash Flow

 Operating activities provided 56.9 million in cash in 2004 compared to
 58.3 million in the prior year period. Improved cash flows from net income
(adjusted for non-cash items) of 57.9 million was more than sufficient to fund
increased working capital requirements as outlined below:

 - Accounts receivables increased 20.6 million during 2004 compared to
 an increase of 40.7 million in 2003, reflecting the higher level of
 fourth quarter sales in both years and in 2003, comparatively strong
 late in the year sales. Days sales outstanding, a measure of working
 capital efficiency that

19
 
 measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding, was
 approximately 28 days in both 2004 and 2003.

 - Inventory increased 8.5 million during 2004 compared to decreasing
 51.4 million in 2003. The 2004 increase results from an average
 increase in raw material costs of approximately 9.7 and early
 purchase of approximately 6.0 million in raw materials in advance of
 announced price increases partially offset by reductions in new and
 used trailer units. The 2003 decrease results principally from the
 reduction of new and used trailer units in inventory. Inventory turns,
 a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures
 how quickly inventory turns, of 10 times in 2004 was comparable to the
 prior year.

 - Finance contracts decreased 11.4 million in 2004 from 2003 as the
 wind down of our financing business continues.

 Investing activities used 8.7 million in cash during 2004, a decrease of
 69.0 million from the cash provided in 2003, which included proceeds of 53.5
million from the sale of certain assets of our trailer leasing and rental and
aftermarket parts businesses. The 2004 period included capital expenditures of
 15.5 million, partially offset by proceeds of 6.8 million primarily from the
sale of closed properties.

 Financing activities used 18.9 million in cash during 2004 primarily for
the repayment of 98.8 million in debt from proceeds of a 75.7 million issuance
of common stock with the remainder coming from operating cash flows. With the
exception of the convertible notes, we were able to pay-off substantially all of
our indebtedness in 2004.

Capital Expenditures

 Capital spending amounted to approximately 15.5 million for 2004 and is
anticipated to be in the range of 25-35 million for 2005. Spending in 2005 is
planned to include approximately 10 million for the first phase of a 40
million multi-year program to replace four trailer assembly lines, approximately
 12 million of a 20 million two-year project for engineering and business
process systems improvements and approximately 7 million for normal
maintenances.

Outlook

 The industry recovery that began in 2003 is expected to continue into 2005
and beyond. ACT estimates that production of trailers in 2005 will be
approximately 271,000 units. The continued expansion in production is predicated
on a number of factors including improving general economic conditions and
pent-up trucking industry demand for replacement units as the average age of
trailer fleets increases.

 We expect to participate in the industry growth because (1) our core
customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry, (2) our
DuraPlate(R) trailer continues to have increased market acceptance, (3) our
focus on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailers maintenance
costs, and (4) the success we are achieving expanding our presence into the
middle market carriers - approximately 1,250 carriers with fleet sizes ranging
from 250 to 7,500 units that represent a fleet that totals approximately one
million trailers. In 2004, we added approximately 225 new customers and sold
approximately 6,000 units to this segment of the market.

 We believe that Wabash is well positioned to benefit from an increased
demand for trailers because of the improvements that have been made over the
last three years. As a result of our continuous improvement initiatives, we have
reduced the total cost of producing a trailer and effectively increased
production capacity. Additionally, we have become much more efficient in the use
of working capital. Key to 2005 will be our ability to manage through the
customers perception that raw material prices will decline in the near term with
a corresponding decrease in new trailer prices. This perception results in
reduced order size and delays in order placement.

 As of December 31, 2004, our liquidity position, cash on hand and available
borrowing capacity amounted to approximately 117.6 million and debt and lease
obligations, both on and off the balance sheet, amounted to approximately 132.6
million (including 5.1 million not on the balance sheet). We expect that in
2005, Wabash will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to
fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

 A summary of payments of our contractual obligations and commercial
commitments, both on and off balance sheet, as of December 31, 2004 are as

Residual Guarantees represent purchase commitments related to certain new
and used trailer transactions as well as certain production equipment. We also
have purchase options of 52.8 million on the aforementioned trailers and
equipment. To the extent that the value of the underlying property is less than
the residual guarantee and the value is not expected to be recovered, we have
recorded a loss contingency.

 Purchase Commitments include raw material purchase commitments and minimum
purchase commitments under a parts purchase agreement we entered into in
connection with the sale of certain assets of our aftermarket parts distribution
business. The raw material commitments relate to 33.3 million of aluminum
purchases. Under the parts purchase agreement, we are required to purchase
approximately 12.0 million and 9.0 million in parts from the buyer in 2005 and
2006, respectively. We do not believe the purchase commitments will exceed
business requirements.

 Operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS

 We entered into no off-balance sheet financing transactions in 2003 and
2004. As of December 31, 2004, we have operating leases with future minimum
lease payments of 5.1 million, as disclosed in the preceding table.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 2
to our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies
require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the
appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature,
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These
judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts,
our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers
and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:

 - it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain
 at the time we were making the estimate; and

 - changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have
 selected would have had a material impact on our financial or results
 of operations.

21
 
 The table below presents information about the nature and rationale for
Wabash's critical accounting estimates:

In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that
require estimation, but are not as critical as those discussed above. Changes in
estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our
consolidated financial statements. The determination of the fair market value of
new and used trailers is subject to variation particularly in times of rapidly
changing market conditions. A 5 change in the valuation of our inventories
would be approximately 5 million.

OTHER

 INFLATION

 We have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through
productivity improvements as well as selective price increases. As a result,
inflation has not had, and is not expected to have a significant impact on our
business.

 CUSTOMER CREDIT RISK

 We sublease certain highly specialized RoadRailer(R) equipment to Grupo
Transportation Marititma Mexicana SA (TMM), who is experiencing financial
difficulties. In August 2004, TMM completed the restructuring

22
 
of its debt agreements and is in the process of selling certain assets. Customer
payments, which have historically been timely, are behind schedule. The customer
owes us 7.3 million secured by highly specialized RoadRailer(R) equipment,
which due to the nature of the equipment, has a minimal recovery value.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

 INVENTORY COSTS

 In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs - an amendment
of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4. The Statement clarifies
that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
wasted materials should be recognized as current-period expenses regardless of
how abnormal the circumstances. In addition, this Statement requires that the
allocation of fixed overheads to the costs of conversion be based upon normal
production capacity levels. The Statement is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not anticipate
that this Statement will have a material effect on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.

 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based
Payment. SFAS No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, superceded APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statements of Cash Flows. Statement
No. 123 (R) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements
based upon their fair value. The current pro forma disclosure of the impact on
earnings is no longer allowed. The Statement is effective for the first interim
or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. Based upon currently
outstanding options expense calculated using the Black-Scholes model, the
impact, net of tax, could amount to approximately 1.1 million during the second
half of 2005 and 0.7 million in 2006.
