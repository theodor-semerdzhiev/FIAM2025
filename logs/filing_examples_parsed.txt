Item 7B Risk Factors.................................................................... 24 ITEM 7B - RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report before investing in our securities. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
WE HAVE GENERATED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN RECENT PERIODS.
We incurred significant net losses during the three years prior to 2004. In 2004, we reported net income of 58.4 million, but we reported net losses of 232.2 million, 56.2 million and 57.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will depend on the successful continued implementation of measures to reduce costs and achieve sales goals, as well as the ability to pass on to customers increases in raw materials and components. While we have taken steps to lower operating costs and reduce interest expense, and have seen our sales improve in recent periods, we cannot assure you that our cost-reduction measures will be successful, sales will be sustained or increased or that we will achieve a sustained return to profitability.

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
OUR INVENTORIES ARE NOT MANAGED BY PERPETUAL INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEMS.
The systems and processes we use to manage and value our inventories require significant manual intervention and the verification of actual quantities requires physical inventories, which we take several times a year. Breakdowns of these systems and processes, and errors in inventory estimates derived from these systems and processes, could go undetected until the next physical inventory and adversely affect our operations and financial results.

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OR IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.
We have relationships with a number of customers where we supply the requirements of these customers. We do not have binding agreements with these customers. Our success is dependent, to a significant extent, upon the continued strength of these relationships and the growth of our core customers. We often are unable to predict the level of demand for our products from these customers, or the timing of their orders. In addition, the same economic conditions that adversely affect us also often adversely affect our customers. As some of our customers are highly leveraged and have limited access to capital, their continued existence may be uncertain. One of our customers, Grupo Transportation Marititma Mexicana SA (TMM), which is located in Mexico, has been experiencing financial difficulties even though it restructured its debt in August 2004, and is in the process of selling certain of its assets. Payments from TMM to us are currently behind schedule. The customer owes us 7.3 million as of December 31, 2004 secured by highly specialized RoadRailer(R) equipment, which due to the nature of the equipment, has a minimal recovery value. The loss of a significant customer or unexpected delays in product purchases could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS MAY NOT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.
We continue to introduce new products, such as the DuraPlateHD(R) and the Freight-Pro(R) trailer. We cannot assure you that these or other new products or technologies will achieve sustained market acceptance. In addition, new technologies or products that our competitors introduce may render our products obsolete or uncompetitive. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights in our new products. However, the steps we have taken to protect them may not be sufficient or may not be enforced by a court of law. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, other parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.

---------- Risk Chunk 6 ----------
WE HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OF RAW MATERIALS; AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components in the manufacturing of truck trailers, such as tires, landing gear, axles and specialty steel coil used in DuraPlate(R) panels. From time to time, there have been and may in the future continue to be shortages of supplies of raw materials or our suppliers may place us on allocation, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to meet demand for our products. Raw material shortages and allocations may result in inefficient operations and a build-up of inventory, which can negatively affect our working capital position. In addition, if the price of raw materials were to increase and we were unable to increase our selling prices or reduce our operating costs to offset the price increases, our operating margins would be adversely affected. The loss of any of our suppliers or their inability to meet our price, quality, quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 7 ----------
DISRUPTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
We manufacture our products at two trailer manufacturing facilities in Lafayette, Indiana, and one hardwood floor facility in Harrison, Arkansas. Our primary manufacturing facility accounts for approximately 85 of our manufacturing output. An unexpected disruption in our production at either of these facilities or in our management information systems for any length of time would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 8 ----------
THE LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Many of our executive officers, including our CEO William P. Greubel and COO Richard J. Giromini, are critical to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on the operation of our business, as we may be unable to find suitable management to replace departing executives on a timely basis.

---------- Risk Chunk 9 ----------
THE INABILITY TO REALIZE ADDITIONAL COSTS SAVINGS COULD WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

---------- Risk Chunk 10 ----------
If we are unable to continue to successfully implement our program of cost reduction and continuous improvement, we may not realize additional anticipated cost savings, which could weaken our competitive position.

---------- Risk Chunk 11 ----------
WE ARE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.
We are subject to currency exchange rate risk related to sales through our factory-owned retail distribution centers in Canada. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of 0.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively, on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that future currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have an adverse affect on our results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 12 ----------
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS COULD LIMIT OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING FLEXIBILITY AND SUBJECT US TO OTHER RISKS.
The agreements governing our indebtedness include certain covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to:
- incur additional debt;
- pay dividends on our common stock in excess of 10 million per year;
- repurchase our common stock;
- consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;
- make certain investments, mergers and acquisitions; and
- create certain liens.
Additionally, should our available borrowing capacity drop below 40 million, we would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which could limit our ability to make capital expenditures and further limit the amount of dividends we could pay.
Our ability to comply with such agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable.
RISKS PARTICULAR TO THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE

---------- Risk Chunk 13 ----------
OUR BUSINESS IS HIGHLY CYCLICAL, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The truck trailer manufacturing industry historically has been and is expected to continue to be cyclical, as well as affected by overall economic conditions. New trailer production for the trailer industry reached its most recent peak of approximately 306,000 units in 1999, falling to approximately 140,000 by 2001 and rebounding to approximately 229,000 units in 2004. Customers historically have replaced trailers in cycles that run from five to twelve years, depending on service and trailer type. Poor economic conditions can adversely affect demand for new trailers and in the past have led to an overall aging of trailer fleets beyond this typical replacement cycle. Customers' buying patterns can also reflect regulatory changes, such as the new federal hours-of-service rules and anticipated 2007 federal emissions standards. Our business is likely to continue to be highly cyclical based on current and expected economic conditions and regulatory factors.

---------- Risk Chunk 14 ----------
SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY RESULT IN OUR COMPETITORS OFFERING NEW OR BETTER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR LOWER PRICES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND A DECREASE IN OUR REVENUES.
The truck trailer manufacturing industry is highly competitive. We compete with other manufacturers of varying sizes, some of which may have greater financial resources than we do. Barriers to entry in the standard truck trailer manufacturing industry are low. As a result, it is possible that additional competitors could enter the market at any time. In the recent past, the manufacturing over-capacity and high leverage of some of our competitors, along with the bankruptcies and financial stresses that affected the industry, contributed to significant pricing pressures.
If we are unable to compete successfully with other trailer manufacturers, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline. In addition, competitive pressures in the industry may affect the market prices of our new and used equipment, which, in turn, may adversely affect our sales margins and results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 15 ----------
WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR COSTS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH, OR OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications of truck trailers are regulated by individual states. The Federal government also regulates certain truck trailer safety features, such as lamps, reflective devices, tires, air-brake systems and rear-impact guards. Changes or anticipation of changes in these regulations can have a material impact on our financial results, as our customers may defer purchasing decisions and we may have to reengineer products. In addition, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation, storage, presence, use, disposal and handling of hazardous materials, discharge of storm water and underground fuel storage tanks and may be subject to liability associated with operations of prior owners of acquired property. In 2004, we paid 0.4 million and agreed to a compliance agreement with the EPA related to violations of the federal Clean Water Act at our former Huntsville, Tennessee manufacturing facility.
If we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations in the future, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our costs of complying with these or any other current or future environmental regulations may be significant. In addition, if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions.

---------- Risk Chunk 16 ----------
A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF USED TRAILERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
General economic and industry conditions, as well as the supply of used trailers, influence the value of used trailers. As part of our normal business practices, we maintain used trailer inventories and have entered into finance contracts secured by used trailers, as well as residual guarantees and purchase commitments for used trailers. Declines in the market value for used trailers or the need to dispose of excess inventories has had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 17 ----------
PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS.
As a manufacturer of products widely used in commerce, we are subject to regular product liability claims as well as warranty and similar claims alleging defective products. From time to time claims may involve material amounts and novel legal theories, and any insurance we carry may prove inadequate to insulate us from material liabilities for these claims.
RISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK

---------- Risk Chunk 18 ----------
OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, PRICE VOLATILITY AND A LOW TRADING VOLUME.
The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations. Our common stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including:
- trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate;
- changes in the market price of the products we sell;
- the introduction of new technologies or products by us or our competitors;
- changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;
- operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;
- announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, financings or capital commitments;
- changes in laws and regulations; and
- general economic and competitive conditions.
This volatility may adversely affect the prices of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. The price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of our 3 1/4 convertible senior notes due 2008. Assuming 125 million in aggregate principal amount of these notes are converted at a conversion price of 19.20, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding would increase by 6.5 million, or approximately 21 . The conversion feature of our 3 1/4 convertible senior notes is subject to adjustment in connection with the payment of cash dividends. As a result of any future payment of a cash dividend, upon any conversion of the notes we would be required to issue additional shares of common stock.

---------- Risk Chunk 19 ----------
In addition, our common stock has experienced low trading volume in the past.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
12 Item 1A. Risk Factors

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
Our success depends on our ability to respond to changes in customer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner.
We have historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to our merchandise assortments. Our future success depends on our ability to consistently anticipate, assess and react to the changing demands of our multi-channel customer-base. If we fail to anticipate fashion trends, select the right merchandise assortment, maintain appropriate inventory levels and creatively present merchandise in a way that is appealing to our customer-base on a consistent basis our sales could decline significantly, and we could then be required to mark down certain merchandise to significantly lower prices to sell excess inventory, which would result in lower gross margins. As a private label merchandiser, we assume certain risks, including long product lead times and high initial purchase commitments, that amplify the consequences of any miscalculation that we might make in anticipating fashion trends or interpreting them for our customers. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and offer merchandise that appeals to our customer-base or that the introduction of new merchandise categories will be successful or profitable.

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
We have made significant investments in our product development and merchandising infrastructure that may not result in increased sales or profitability.
In fiscal 2004, we made significant investments in our product development and merchandising infrastructure. We spent approximately 4.8 million more in this area in fiscal 2004 than we did in fiscal 2003 to upgrade our operating infrastructure and processes in the areas of design, product management, sourcing, product integrity, supply chain operations and merchandising. We currently expect to continue to invest in this area in the future. While we believe that our investments in this area will help to support the growth and increasing complexity of our business and will result in merchandise assortments that are better in quality and fit, there can be no assurance that the changes we are making will result in increased sales or profitability in the future.

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
Our future success will depend upon brand awareness and the effectiveness of our marketing programs.
Our future success will depend upon our ability to effectively define, evolve and promote our lifestyle brand. In order to achieve and maintain significant brand name recognition, we will need to increase investments in the development of the brand through various means, including customer research, advertising and promotional events, direct mail marketing and internet marketing. We can provide no assurance that the marketing strategies we implement and the investments we make will be successful in building significant brand awareness or attracting new customers.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
Our ability to increase the Company's overall profitability will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully redefine our direct segment business strategy and our direct business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
As we continue our retail store rollout, a growing percentage of our historic catalog and internet customers live in relatively close proximity to one of our retail stores. As a result, many of these customers now shop at our retail stores, resulting in fewer catalog and internet orders in these areas. In addition, certain initiatives we have been implementing to improve our results in retail opening additional stores, aligning our catalog mailing dates with the dates we introduce new retail floor sets, increasing the amount of novelty items in our merchandising assortments and reducing the density of merchandise offerings in the front pages of our catalogs to make them more effective as marketing communications to our retail customers may be detracting from the performance of our direct business. There can be no assurance
that, as our retail business grows, our direct business will not continue to be negatively affected. The operation of our direct business presents a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:
The preparation of our catalogs requires long lead times and, as a result, our ability to make adjustments based on customer response is limited. Any miscalculations in the catalog layout or merchandising selections could cause reduced demand and lower net sales; Each edition of a catalog requires substantial investments in layout and design, paper, printing, postage and inventory prior to mailing which are all costs that cannot be adjusted for a particular mailing in response to the actual performance of the catalog; The operation of our direct business is dependent on our ability to prepare catalogs in a timely manner. Any delay in the completion or delivery of a catalog could cause customers to forego or defer purchases from us; Some of our catalog marketing programs rely on prospect mailings and as a result involve risks not present in mailings to our existing customers, including potentially lower and less predictable response rates and the possibility that third parties who provide customer lists may stop making them available; and The operation of our direct business is dependent on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order taking and fulfillment operations and our website. Disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result in a reduction in net sales as well as increased administrative and order processing costs.

---------- Risk Chunk 6 ----------
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address the risks that the operation of our direct business entails.

---------- Risk Chunk 7 ----------
Our retail store growth strategy may be unsuccessful, and our retail business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Our current growth strategy is primarily based on our retail store initiative. At the present time, we are devoting significant financial resources and operational efforts to the opening and operation of our retail stores. At December 25, 2004, we had 150 retail stores open. During 2005, we plan to continue our retail store growth strategy by opening an additional 40 retail stores. Our continued growth could result in a strain on our management, financial, merchandising, marketing, distribution and other resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage this growth effectively or that our retail store initiative will be successful, and if it is not, our business and financial condition would be adversely affected. The operation of retail stores presents a number of risks and uncertainties, including the following:
We are required to make long-term financial commitments when leasing retail store locations; We make substantial investments in store design, leasehold improvements and other areas prior to the opening of each store, and thereafter, we must continue to maintain our store facilities; Our retail store assets and personnel are substantially under the control of individual store management. We rely on our store managers to ensure that our assets are secure, our store employees are properly trained and managed and our stores are operating effectively. If we are unable to effectively manage our retail stores, our sales could decline and our assets could be inadequately safeguarded; We must hire and retain qualified retail sales and management personnel in the areas where our stores are located; and The success of our individual stores may depend significantly on the success of the shopping malls or lifestyle centers in which they are located.

---------- Risk Chunk 8 ----------
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address the risks that the operation of retail stores entails.

---------- Risk Chunk 9 ----------
The women's apparel market is highly competitive.
We are in a highly competitive market. Our retail initiative has exposed us to additional competitors. The perceived growth opportunities within the women's apparel market has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, including a few large, well known and established specialty retailers, as well as increased competition from existing companies. Many of our competitors are considerably larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with them in the future.

---------- Risk Chunk 10 ----------
Our overseas merchandise purchasing strategy makes it vulnerable to a number of risks.
We purchase a significant portion of our merchandise directly from foreign sources. Approximately 78 of the merchandise purchased in fiscal 2004 was purchased directly from foreign sources, primarily located in China. In addition, goods purchased from domestic vendors may be sourced abroad by such vendors. We are in the early stages of implementing a long-range supply chain initiative, which includes the potential for additional international expansion of our development and sourcing functions in the future. We expect that we will continue to purchase significant amounts of merchandise from foreign sources in the future.
As a result of our overseas merchandise purchase strategy, our operations are subject to the normal risks and burdens of purchasing merchandise abroad, including customs compliance, import duties or restrictions, greater difficulty in supervising distant suppliers, work stoppages, and in certain parts of the world, political and economic instability. If inventory receipts are delayed, we might be unable to fulfill certain orders and replenish inventory levels, which could result in canceled orders or lost sales.
We seek to enforce a code of conduct that sets guidelines for our vendors regarding employment practices such as wages and benefits, health and safety, working hours and working age, and for environmental, ethical and legal matters. Although we believe we are allocating appropriate resources to monitor for compliance with our standards, if we or an outside third party discovers that any of our vendors are engaged in practices that materially violate our vendor code of conduct or other generally accepted social responsibility standards, our sales could be materially affected by any resulting negative publicity.

---------- Risk Chunk 11 ----------
Any determination that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our stock price.
We are applying significant management and financial resources to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting in order to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that our controls will be adequate or effective in preventing fraud or human error. Any failure in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material effect on our financial reporting or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, which upon disclosure, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.

---------- Risk Chunk 12 ----------
Our sales tax collection policy may expose us to certain risks.
Prior to the merger of our retail subsidiary and our catalog/internet subsidiary in July 2003, our catalog/internet subsidiary collected sales tax on our catalog and internet sales only in Massachusetts. Since the time of the merger, we have been collecting sales tax on our catalog and internet sales in states where we have retail stores. Many states have attempted to require that out-of-state direct marketers and internet retailers collect sales taxes on sales of products shipped to their residents, but the legality of the imposition
of such taxes is unsettled. Although we believe that we have collected sales tax where we are required to do so under existing law, state tax authorities may disagree.

---------- Risk Chunk 13 ----------
Our success is dependent on the performance of our vendors and service providers.
Our business depends on the performance of third parties, including manufacturers and foreign buying agents, telecommunications service providers, the United States Postal Service, United Parcel Service, shipping companies, our construction manager, landlords, building consultants, building contractors, paper manufacturers, printers, photographers, creative designers and models, credit card processing companies, the service bureau that maintains our customer database, and our overflow call center.
Any interruptions or delays in these services could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Although we believe that, in general, the goods and services we obtain from third parties could be purchased from other sources, identifying and obtaining substitute goods and services could result in delays and increased costs. We do not maintain supply contracts with any of our private label or other merchandise vendors. Rather, we acquire merchandise via purchase orders that terminate upon completion of the order. If any significant merchandise vendor or buying agent were to suddenly discontinue its relationship with us, we could experience temporary delivery delays until a substitute supplier could be found.

---------- Risk Chunk 14 ----------
Our business is subject to a number of external costs that we are unable to control.
Our business is subject to a number of external costs that we are unable to control, including labor costs, insurance costs, printing, paper and postage expenses, shipping charges associated with distributing merchandise to our customers and stores, retail store facility rental and construction costs, and inventory acquisition costs, including product costs, quota and customs charges. Any increase in these or other external costs could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

---------- Risk Chunk 15 ----------
Talented personnel are critical to our success.
Our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to retain key personnel, particularly Gordon R. Cooke, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and to continue to attract talented new personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Cooke or one or more of our current members of senior management, or our failure to attract talented new employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

---------- Risk Chunk 16 ----------
A major failure of our information systems could harm our business.
We depend on information systems to operate our website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause information to be lost or delayed which could have a negative impact on our business. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer "hackers" or other causes. We cannot assure that our systems will be adequate to support future growth.

---------- Risk Chunk 17 ----------
The market price of our common stock is volatile.
The market price of our common stock has fluctuated from period to period substantially since our initial public offering in 1993. We believe factors such as quarterly operating results, changes in market conditions, securities analysts' estimates of future operating results, and the overall performance of the stock market may cause the market price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate significantly.

---------- Risk Chunk 18 ----------
Our operating results fluctuate.
Our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated, and we expect these fluctuations to continue. Among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are customer response to merchandise offerings, the timing of the rollout of our new retail stores, seasonal variations in sales, the timing and size of catalog mailings, the costs of producing and mailing catalogs, the timing of merchandise receipts, the level of merchandise returns, changes in merchandise mix and presentation, and unanticipated operating costs and other factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors.
Our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future net sales and, as a result, net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in net sales for that period. In addition, our retail store business is more seasonal than our direct business.

---------- Risk Chunk 19 ----------
As a result of all of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.

---------- Risk Chunk 20 ----------
Negative economic or political conditions could harm our business.
Our success is influenced by a number of economic conditions affecting consumer disposable income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates and taxation rates. In addition, our success is influenced by a number of political conditions affecting consumer confidence such as war, terrorism and political unrest. Adverse changes in economic and political conditions may restrict consumer spending, thereby negatively affecting our growth and profitability.

---------- Risk Chunk 21 ----------
Potential acquirers might be frustrated by certain provisions in Delaware law, our charter and our by-laws.
Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock. Those provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and Delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our Board of Directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, those provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could negatively affect our stock price.

Item 7B.
Risk Factors. Item 7B. Risk Factors

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
Changes in economic conditions may cause us to incur loan and lease losses.
The inability of borrowers to repay loans and leases can erode our earnings and capital. Our loan and lease portfolio is somewhat less diversified than that of a traditional community bank because it includes a higher concentration of larger commercial loans. Substantially all of our loans and leases are to businesses and individuals in the Denver and Phoenix metropolitan areas, and any economic decline in these market areas could impact us adversely.

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
Our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses.
As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan and lease portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors. If our assumptions are wrong, our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses, thereby having an adverse effect on our operating results, and may cause us to increase the allowance in the future. In addition, although our level of delinquencies historically has been low, we have been increasing and expect to continue to increase the number and amount of loans and leases we originate and we cannot assure you that we will not experience an increase in delinquencies and losses as these loans and leases continue to age, particularly if the favorable economic conditions in Colorado and Arizona reverse. The actual amount of future provisions for loan and lease losses cannot now be determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions. Additions to our allowance for loan and lease losses would decrease our net income.

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
Our business is subject to various lending risks depending on the nature of the borrower s business, its cash flow and our collateral.
Our commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans, and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Rental income may not rise sufficiently over time to meet increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in operating expenses, such as utilities and taxes. As a result, impaired loans may be more difficult to identify without some seasoning. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the security for the loan may be impaired.
Repayment of our commercial loans is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.
Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs to construct and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental
regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. Delays in completing the project may arise from labor problems, material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies. If the estimate of construction costs is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds to complete construction. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project.
Our consumer loans generally have a higher risk of default than our other loans. Consumer loans entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability, and thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various Federal and state laws, including Federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
Repayment of our direct financing leases is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these leases may fluctuate in value. Leases are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Generally, leases finance 100 of the cost of the equipment, which represents the underlying collateral. The collateral securing equipment leases may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
We may experience difficulties in managing our growth.
As part of our strategy, we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by undertaking additional de novo branch openings or new bank formations. We believe that it may take up to eighteen months for new banking facilities to first achieve operational profitability, due to the impact of overhead expenses and the start-up phase of generating loans and deposits. To the extent that we undertake growth initiatives, we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets.
In addition, we may acquire financial institutions and related businesses that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage such growth. Acquiring other financial institutions and businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:
potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of financial institutions and other businesses we acquire;
exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired banks or businesses;
difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire;
potential disruption to our business;
potential diversion of our management s time and attention; and
the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire.

---------- Risk Chunk 6 ----------
We rely heavily on our management, and the loss of any of our senior officers may adversely affect our operations.
Consistent with our policy of focusing growth initiatives on the recruitment of qualified personnel, we are highly dependent on the continued services of a small number of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The failure to recruit and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

---------- Risk Chunk 7 ----------
Changes in interest rates may affect our profitability.
Our profitability is in part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in such rates. At any given time, our assets and liabilities will be such that they are affected differently by a change in interest rates. As a result, an increase or decrease in rates, the length of loan terms or the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans in our portfolio could have a positive or negative effect on our net income, capital and liquidity. We have traditionally managed our assets and liabilities in such a way that we have a positive interest rate gap. As a general rule, banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates and are more likely to experience increases in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates.

---------- Risk Chunk 8 ----------
Our business and financial condition may be adversely affected by an increase in competition.
The banking business in the Denver and Phoenix metropolitan areas is highly competitive and is currently dominated by a number of large regional financial institutions. In addition to these regional banks, there are a number of smaller commercial banks that operate in these areas. We compete for loans and deposits with banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions and mortgage bankers. In addition to traditional financial institutions, we also compete for loans with brokerage and investment banking companies and governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers. Particularly in times of high interest rates, we also face significant competition for deposits from sellers of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
By virtue of their larger capital bases or affiliation with larger multibank holding companies, many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources and lending limits than we have and perform other functions that we offer only through correspondents. Interstate banking and unlimited state-wide branch banking are permitted in Colorado and Arizona. As a result, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, greater competition in our primary service areas. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by an increase in competition. Moreover, recently enacted and proposed legislation has focused on expanding the ability of participants in the banking and thrift industries to engage in other lines of business. The enactment of such legislation could put us at a competitive disadvantage because we may not have the capital to participate in other lines of business to the same extent as more highly capitalized financial service holding companies.

---------- Risk Chunk 9 ----------
We continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.
The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.

---------- Risk Chunk 10 ----------
We may be required to make capital contributions to the bank if it becomes undercapitalized.
Under federal law, a bank holding company may be required to guarantee a capital plan filed by an undercapitalized bank subsidiary with its primary regulator. If the subsidiary defaults under the plan, the holding company may be required to contribute to the capital of the subsidiary bank in an amount equal to the lesser of 5 of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the bank into compliance with applicable capital standards. Therefore, it is possible that we will be required to contribute capital to our subsidiary bank or any other bank that we may acquire in the event that such bank becomes undercapitalized. If we are required to make such capital contribution at a time when we have other significant capital needs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

---------- Risk Chunk 11 ----------
We are subject to significant government regulation, and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us.
The banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. These regulations are primarily intended to protect customers, not our creditors or stockholders. As a financial holding company, we are also subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, in addition to other regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of such changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition.

---------- Risk Chunk 1 ----------
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our company and our business.

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
Public Storage has significant influence over us.
At December 31, 2004, Public Storage and its affiliates owned 24.8 of the outstanding shares of our common stock (43.7 upon conversion of its interest in our operating partnership) and 25.1 of the outstanding common units of our operating partnership (100 of the common units not owned by us). Also, Ronald L. Havner, Jr., our Chairman of the Board, is also Vice-Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Public Storage and Harvey Lenkin, one of our Directors, is President, Chief Operating Officer, and a Director of Public Storage. Consequently, Public Storage has the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including electing directors, changing our articles of incorporation, dissolving and approving other extraordinary transactions such as mergers, and all matters requiring the consent of the limited partners of the operating partnership. In addition, Public Storage s ownership may make it more difficult for another party to take over our company without Public Storage s approval.

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
Provisions in our organizational documents may prevent changes in control.
Our articles generally prohibit owning more than 7 of our shares: Our articles of incorporation restrict the number of shares that may be owned by any other person, and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership contains an anti-takeover provision. No shareholder (other than Public Storage and certain other specified shareholders) may own more than 7 of the outstanding shares of our common stock, unless our board of directors waives this limitation. We imposed this limitation to avoid, to the extent possible, a concentration of ownership that might jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT. This limitation, however, also makes a change of control much more difficult (if not impossible) even if it may be favorable to our public shareholders. These provisions will prevent future takeover attempts not approved by Public Storage even if a majority of our public shareholders consider it to be in their best interests because they would receive a premium for their shares over the shares then market value or for other reasons.
Our board can set the terms of certain securities without shareholder approval: Our board of directors is authorized, without shareholder approval, to issue up to 50,000 shares of preferred stock and up to 100,000,000 shares of equity stock, in each case in one or more series. Our board has the right to set the terms of each of these series of stock. Consequently, the board could set the terms of a series of stock that could make it difficult (if not impossible) for another party to take over our company even if it might be favorable to our public shareholders. Our articles of incorporation also contain other provisions that could have the same effect. We can also cause our operating partnership to issue additional interests for cash or in exchange for property.
The partnership agreement of our operating partnership restricts mergers: The partnership agreement of our operating partnership generally provides that we may not merge or engage in a similar transaction unless the limited partners of our operating partnership are entitled to receive the same proportionate payments as our shareholders. In addition, we have agreed not to merge unless the merger would have been approved had the limited partners been able to vote together with our shareholders, which has the effect of increasing Public Storage s influence over us due to Public Storage s ownership of operating partnership units. These provisions may make it more difficult for us to merge with another entity.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
Our operating partnership poses additional risks to us.
Limited partners of our operating partnership, including Public Storage, have the right to vote on certain changes to the partnership agreement. They may vote in a way that is against the interests of our shareholders. Also, as general partner of our operating partnership, we are required to protect the interests of the limited partners of the operating partnership. The interests of the limited partners and of our shareholders may differ.

---------- Risk Chunk 6 ----------
We cannot sell certain properties without Public Storage s approval.
Prior to 2007, we are prohibited from selling 10 specified properties without Public Storage s approval. Since Public Storage would be taxed on a sale of these properties, the interests of Public Storage and our other shareholders may differ as to the best time to sell such properties.

---------- Risk Chunk 7 ----------
We would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a REIT.
Our cash flow would be reduced if we fail to qualify as a REIT: While we believe that we have qualified since 1990 to be taxed as a REIT, and will continue to be so qualified, we cannot be certain. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we need to satisfy certain requirements under the federal income tax laws relating to our income, assets, distributions to shareholders and shareholder base. In this regard, the share ownership limits in our articles of incorporation do not necessarily ensure that our shareholder base is sufficiently diverse for us to qualify as a REIT. For any year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at regular corporate tax rates on our taxable income unless certain relief provisions apply. Taxes would reduce our cash available for distributions to shareholders or for reinvestment, which could adversely affect us and our shareholders. Also we would not be allowed to elect REIT status for five years after we fail to qualify unless certain relief provisions apply.
Our cash flow would be reduced if our predecessor failed to qualify as a REIT: For us to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, our predecessor, American Office Park Properties, also needed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. We believe American Office Park Properties qualified as a REIT beginning in 1997 until its March 1998 merger with us. If it is determined that it did not qualify as a REIT, we could also lose our REIT qualification. Before 1997, our predecessor was a taxable corporation and, to qualify as a REIT, was required to distribute all of its profits before the end of 1996. While we believe American Office Park Properties qualified as a REIT since 1997, we did not obtain an opinion of an outside expert at the time of its merger with us.
We may need to borrow funds to meet our REIT distribution requirements: To qualify as a REIT, we must generally distribute to our shareholders 90 of our taxable income. Our income consists primarily of our share of our Operating Partnership s income. We intend to make sufficient distributions to qualify as a REIT and otherwise avoid corporate tax. However, differences in timing between income and expenses and the need to make nondeductible expenditures such as capital improvements and principal payments on debt could force us to borrow funds to make necessary shareholder distributions.

---------- Risk Chunk 8 ----------
Since we buy and operate real estate, we are subject to general real estate investment and operating risks.
Summary of real estate risks: We own and operate commercial properties and are subject to the risks of owning real estate generally and commercial properties in particular. These risks include:
the national, state and local economic climate and real estate conditions, such as oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates;
how prospective tenants perceive the attractiveness, convenience and safety of our properties;
our ability to provide adequate management, maintenance and insurance;
our ability to collect rent from tenants on a timely basis;
the expense of periodically renovating, repairing and reletting spaces;
environmental issues;
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other federal, state, and local laws and regulations;
increasing operating costs, including real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, if these increased costs cannot be passed through to tenants;
changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws;
increase in new commercial properties in our market;
tenant defaults and bankruptcies;
tenant s right to sublease space; and
concentration of properties leased to non-rated private companies.
Certain significant costs, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, generally are not reduced even when a property s rental income is reduced. In addition, environmental and tax laws, interest rate levels, the availability of financing and other factors may affect real estate values and property income. Furthermore, the supply of commercial space fluctuates with market conditions.
If our properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including any debt service, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs, and we may have to reduce our distributions to shareholders.
We recently acquired a large property in a new market: In December 2003, we acquired an industrial park in Miami, Florida. This is our only property in this market and represents approximately 18.5 of our portfolio s aggregate net rentable square footage at December 31, 2004. As a result of our lack of experience with the Miami market and other factors, the operating performance of this property may be less than we anticipate, and we may have difficulty in integrating this property into our existing portfolio.
We may encounter significant delays and expense in reletting vacant space, or we may not be able to relet space at existing rates, in each case resulting in losses of income: When leases expire, we will incur expenses in retrofitting space and we may not be able to release the space on the same terms. Certain leases provide tenants with the right to terminate early if they pay a fee. Our properties as of December 31, 2004 generally have lower vacancy rates than the average for the markets in which they are located, and leases accounting for 23.5 of our annual rental income expire in 2005 and 21.2 in 2006. While we have estimated our cost of renewing leases that expire in 2005 and 2006, our estimates could be wrong. If we are unable to release space promptly, if the terms are significantly less favorable than anticipated or if the costs are higher, we may have to reduce our distributions to shareholders.
Tenant defaults and bankruptcies may reduce our cash flow and distributions: We may have difficulty in collecting from tenants in default, particularly if they declare bankruptcy. This could affect our cash flow and distributions to shareholders. Since many of our tenants are non-rated private companies, this risk may be enhanced.
The Company has a lease with Footstar that generates less than 1 of our revenues. Footstar and its affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Laws in 2004. In connection with such filing, they rejected one of two leases with the Company. The rejected lease consisted of approximately 60,000 square feet in Dallas, Texas, with annual rents of approximately 620,000. No action has been taken with respect to the second lease of 57,000 square feet, with annual rents of approximately 768,000. In September 2004, we restructured a 134,000 square foot lease with a previous top ten tenant in Northern California that reset the term to 10 years and reduced the initial monthly rents by approximately 120,000 per month, with annual increases thereafter. Given the historical uncertainty of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations, we will continue to reserve any income that would have been realized on a straight line basis. Several other tenants have contacted us, requesting early termination of their lease, reduction in space under lease, rent deferment or abatement. At this time, the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any, the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our operating results.
We may be adversely affected by significant competition among commercial properties: Many other commercial properties compete with our properties for tenants. Some of the competing properties may be newer and better located than our properties. We also expect that new properties will be built in our markets. Also, we compete with other buyers, many of whom are larger than us, for attractive commercial properties. Therefore, we may not be able to grow as rapidly as we would like.
We may be adversely affected if casualties to our properties are not covered by insurance: We carry insurance on our properties that we believe is comparable to the insurance carried by other operators for similar properties. However, we could suffer uninsured losses or losses in excess of policy limits for such occurrences such as earthquakes that adversely affect us or even result in loss of the property. We might still remain liable on any mortgage debt or other unsatisfied obligations related to that property.
The illiquidity of our real estate investments may prevent us from adjusting our portfolio to respond to market changes: There may be delays and difficulties in selling real estate. Therefore, we cannot easily change our portfolio when economic conditions change. Also, tax laws limit a REIT s ability to sell properties held for less than four years.
We may be adversely affected by changes in laws: Increases in income and service taxes may reduce our cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and safety codes. If we fail to comply with these requirements, governmental authorities could fine us or courts could award damages against us. We believe our properties comply with all significant legal requirements. However, these requirements could change in a way that would reduce our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders.
We may incur significant environmental remediation costs: Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may have to clean spills or other releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from a property. Certain environmental laws impose liability whether or not the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. In some cases, liability may exceed the value of the property. The presence of toxic substances, or the failure to properly remedy any resulting contamination, may make it more difficult for the owner or operator to sell, lease or operate its property or to borrow money using its property as collateral. Future environmental laws may impose additional material liabilities on us.

---------- Risk Chunk 9 ----------
We are affected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires that access and use by disabled persons of all public accommodations and commercial properties be facilitated. Existing commercial properties must be made accessible to disabled persons. While we have not estimated the cost of complying with this act, we do not believe the cost will be material. We have an ongoing program to bring our properties into what we believe is compliance with the American with Disabilities Act.

---------- Risk Chunk 10 ----------
We depend on external sources of capital to grow our company.
We are generally required under the Internal Revenue Code to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary building and tenant improvements, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we may need to rely on third-party sources of capital to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all. Access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on general market conditions, the market s perception of our growth potential, our current and expected future earnings, our cash flow, and the market price per share of our common stock. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy any debt service obligations, or make cash distributions to shareholders.

---------- Risk Chunk 11 ----------
Our ability to control our properties may be adversely affected by ownership through partnerships and joint ventures.
We own most of our properties through our operating partnership. Our organizational documents do not prevent us from acquiring properties with others through partnerships or joint ventures. This type of investment may present additional risks. For example, our partners may have interests that differ from ours or that conflict with ours, or our partners may become bankrupt. During 2001, we entered into a joint venture
arrangement that held property subject to debt. This joint venture has been liquidated and all debts paid; however, we may enter into similar arrangements with the same partner or other partners.

---------- Risk Chunk 12 ----------
We can change our business policies and increase our level of debt without shareholder approval.
Our board of directors establishes our investment, financing, distribution and our other business policies and may change these policies without shareholder approval. Our organizational documents do not limit our level of debt. A change in our policies or an increase in our level of debt could adversely affect our operations or the price of our common stock.

---------- Risk Chunk 13 ----------
We can issue additional securities without shareholder approval.
We can issue preferred, equity and common stock without shareholder approval. Holders of preferred stock have priority over holders of common stock, and the issuance of additional shares of stock reduces the interest of existing holders in our company.

---------- Risk Chunk 14 ----------
Increases in interest rates may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
One of the factors that influences the market price of our common stock is the annual rate of distributions that we pay on our common stock, as compared with interest rates. An increase in interest rates may lead purchasers of REIT shares to demand higher annual distribution rates, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

---------- Risk Chunk 15 ----------
Shares that become available for future sale may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Substantial sales of our common stock, or the perception that substantial sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2004, Public Storage owned 24.8 of the outstanding shares of our common stock (43.7 upon conversion of its interest in our operating partnership). These shares, as well as shares of common stock held by certain other significant shareholders, are eligible to be sold in the public market, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.

---------- Risk Chunk 16 ----------
We depend on key personnel.
We depend on our key personnel, including Ronald L. Havner, Jr., our Chairman of the Board, and Joseph D. Russell, Jr., our President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Havner, Mr. Russell, or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. We maintain no key person insurance on our key personnel.

---------- Risk Chunk 17 ----------
We may be affected by California s budget shortfall.
The California budget could affect our company in many ways, including the possible repeal of Proposition 13, which could result in higher property taxes. Reduced state and local government spending and the resulting effects on the state and local economies could have an adverse impact on demand for our space. The budget shortfall could impact our company in other ways that cannot be predicted. Approximately 34.2 of our properties net operating income was generated in California for the year ended December 31, 2004.

---------- Risk Chunk 18 ----------
Terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.
Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, such as those that took place on September 11, 2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or its businesses or interests. Attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and thereby impair our operating results. Further, we may not have insurance coverage for all losses caused by a terrorist attack. Such insurance may not be available, or if it is available and we decide to obtain such terrorist coverage, the cost for the insurance may be significant in relationship to the
risk overall. In addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Finally, further terrorist acts could cause the United States to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further impact our business and operating results.

---------- Risk Chunk 19 ----------
Change in taxation of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our shares.
The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, enacted on May 28, 2003, generally reduces to 15 the maximum marginal rate of federal tax payable by individuals on dividends received from a regular C corporation. This reduced tax rate, however, will not apply to dividends paid to individuals by a REIT on its shares except for certain limited amounts. The earnings of a REIT that are distributed to its shareholders still will generally be subject to less federal income taxation on an aggregate basis than earnings of a non-REIT C corporation that are distributed to its shareholders net of corporate-level income tax. The Jobs and Growth Tax Act, however, could cause individual investors to view stocks of regular C corporations as more attractive relative to shares of REITs than was the case prior to the enactment of the legislation because the dividends from regular C corporations, which previously were taxed at the same rate as REIT dividends, now will be taxed at a maximum marginal rate of 15 while REIT dividends will be taxed at a maximum marginal rate of 35 . We cannot predict what effect, if any, the enactment of this legislation may have on the value of our common stock, either in terms of price or relative to other investments. Item 1A. Risk Factors. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of the information contained in such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Moreover, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements.
Overview
The Company owns and operates 18.0 million rentable square feet of multi-tenant flex, industrial and office properties located in eight states.
The Company focuses on increasing profitability and cash flow aimed at maximizing shareholder value. The Company strives to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates when market conditions allow. The Company also acquires properties it believes will create long-term value, and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the Company s strategic objectives or in situations where the Company believes it can optimize cash proceeds. Operating results are driven by income from rental operations and are therefore substantially influenced by rental demand for space within our properties.
In 2004, the Company continued to experience challenging commercial real estate conditions in a number of markets including Dallas, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Austin, Texas and Northern California. These conditions caused downward pressure on rental rates in these markets coupled with increased necessity to give rental concessions. During 2004, the Company began to see signs of improving market conditions in the Southern California, Virginia, Maryland and Miami, Florida markets.
Market conditions, characterized by continued weak demand and over supply, resulted in persistent downward pressure on rental rates coupled with increased necessity to give rental concessions in a number of the Company s markets. The Company experienced increasing transaction costs in 2004. Despite these difficult market conditions, the Company successfully leased or released 5.9 million square feet of space in 2004 and achieved an overall occupancy of 91.1 , as of December 31, 2004. However, net operating income for our Same Park properties decreased from the year ended December 31, 2003 to 2004 by 4.5 million or 3.2 . See further discussion of operating results below.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:
Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation, accrual of operating expenses and accruals for contingencies, each of which we discuss below.
Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), as amended. SAB 101 requires that the following four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the delivery has occurred or services rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. All leases are classified as
operating leases. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Straight-line rent is recognized for all tenants with contractual increases in rent that are not included on the Company s credit watch list. Deferred rent receivables represent rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of billed rents. Reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue. We monitor the collectibility of our receivable balances including the deferred rent receivable on an on-going basis. Based on these reviews, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us. Tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent. As discussed below, management s determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates. Management s estimate of the required allowance is subject to revision as the factors discussed below change and is sensitive to the effect of economic and market conditions on out tenants.
Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses, property taxes and other expenses recoverable from tenants. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible current tenant receivables is performed using a methodology that incorporates specific identification, aging analysis, an overall evaluation of the Company s historical loss trends and the current economic and business environment. The specific identification methodology relies on factors such as the age and nature of the receivables, the payment history and financial condition of the tenant, the Company s assessment of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations, and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant. The Company s allowance also includes a reserve based on historical loss trends not associated with any specific tenant. This reserve as well as the Company s specific identification reserve is reevaluated quarterly based on economic conditions and the current business environment.
Deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreement. Given the longer-term nature of these types of receivables, management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience. Management evaluates the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for the Company s significant tenants designed to assess the tenants financial condition and their ability to meet their lease obligations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company evaluates a property for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the whole portfolio for impairment based on current operating information. In the event that these periodic assessments reflect that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property, the Company would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on subjective assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property. It requires management to make assumptions related to the property such as future rental rates, tenant allowances, operating expenditures, property taxes, capital improvements, occupancy levels, and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property. These assumptions could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144 provides that the future cash flows used in this analysis be considered on an undiscounted basis, our historically established intent to hold properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material.
Depreciation: We compute depreciation on our buildings and equipment using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of generally 30 and 5 years. A significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building and building components (usually 75-85 ). The allocation of the acquisition cost to building and building components, as well as, the determination of their useful lives are based on management s estimates. If we do not appropriately allocate to these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components, our computation of depreciation expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods, which will affect net income. In addition, the net book value of real estate assets could be over or understated. The statement of cash flows, however, would not be affected.
Accruals of Operating Expenses: The Company accrues for property tax expenses, performance bonuses and other operating expenses each quarter based on historical trends and anticipated disbursements. If these estimates are incorrect, the timing of expense recognition will be affected.
Accruals for Contingencies: The Company is exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that may have occurred, but in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable. Future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Effect of Economic Conditions on the Company s Operations: During 2003 and 2004, the Company has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity in the United States. These effects include a decline in occupancy rates, a reduction in market rental rates throughout the portfolio, increased rent concessions, tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions, slower than expected lease-up of the Company s newly acquired properties, increased tenant defaults and the termination of leases pursuant to early termination options.
The reduction in occupancies and market rental rates has been the result of several factors related to general economic conditions. There are more businesses contracting than expanding, more businesses failing than starting-up and general uncertainty for businesses, resulting in slower decision-making and requests for shorter-term leases. There is also more competing vacant space, including substantial amounts of sub-lease space, in many of the Company s markets. Many of the Company s properties have lower vacancy rates than the average rates for the markets in which they are located; consequently, the Company may have difficulty in maintaining its occupancy rates as leases expire.
The Company has a lease with Footstar that generates less than 1 of our revenues. Footstar and its affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Laws in 2004. In connection with such filing, they rejected one of two leases with the Company. The rejected lease consisted of approximately 60,000 square feet in Dallas, Texas, with annual rents of approximately 620,000. No action has been taken with respect to the second lease of 57,000 square feet, with annual rents of approximately 768,000. In September 2004, we restructured a 134,000 square foot lease with a previous top ten tenant in Northern California that reset the term to 10 years and reduced the initial monthly rents by approximately 120,000 per month, with annual increases thereafter. Given the historical uncertainty of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations, we will continue to reserve any income that would have been realized on a straight line basis. Several other tenants have contacted us, requesting early termination of their lease, reduction in space under lease, rent deferment or abatement. At this time, the Company cannot anticipate what impact, if any, the ultimate outcome of these discussions will have on our operating results.
Effect of Economic Conditions on the Company s Primary Markets: The Company has concentrated its operations in nine markets. Each of these markets has been affected by the slowdown in economic activity in some way. The Company s overall view of these markets is summarized below as of December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company has seen rental rates on new leases and renewed leases decrease by an average of 10 from the most recent in place rents prior to renewal or replacements. The Company has compiled the market occupancy information set forth below using third party reports for these
respective markets. These sources are deemed to be reliable by the Company, but there can be no assurance that these reports are accurate.
The Company owns approximately 3.7 million square feet in Southern California. This is one of the more stable markets in the country but continues to experience relatively flat rental rates. Vacancy rates have decreased slightly throughout Southern California for flex, industrial and office space, and range from 10.4 to 14.2 for office and less than 4 for industrial, depending on submarkets and product type. The rental rates for the Company s properties have improved slightly over the past year as economic conditions have improved and the supply of competing product has diminished. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 4.5 .
The Company owns approximately 2.8 million square feet in Northern Virginia, where the overall market vacancy rate is 12.6 as of December 31, 2004. Suburban Washington D.C. submarkets have continued to be positively impacted by increased federal government spending on defense and national security. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 2.2 .
The Company owns approximately 1.2 million square feet in Maryland. The portfolio is primarily located in the Montgomery County submarket which remains stable, with signs of some increase in rental rates. The Company expects the business of the federal government, defense contractors and the biotech industry to remain strong in 2005. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 6.9 .
The Company owns approximately 1.5 million square feet in Northern California with a concentration in South San Francisco, and Sacramento and the Silicon Valley submarket of Santa Clara and North San Jose. The vacancy rates in these submarkets stand at 20.1 , 14.0 and 24.0 , respectively. Market rental rates dropped dramatically in 2004 and 2003. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 4.3 .
The Company owns approximately 1.9 million square feet in the Beaverton submarket of Portland, Oregon. Leasing activity slowed dramatically in 2003 and continued to slow through the first half of 2004. While market conditions have not changed dramatically, the Company has noticed an increase in leasing activity within the market. The vacancy rate in this market is over 22 . On the supply side, the Company does not believe significant new construction starts will occur during 2005 as a lack of demand and availability has had a negative impact on the market rental rates. Leasing activity in the market is occurring generally at rates 25 to 40 below in-place rents. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 18.5 .
The Company owns approximately 1.7 million square feet in the Dallas Metroplex market. The vacancy rate in Las Colinas, where most of the Company s properties are located, has stabilized at levels nearing 20 for office and 12 for industrial flex. Over the last two years, the number of new properties coming on-line decreased; however some new construction commenced. The Company believes that any such new construction could cause vacancy rates to rise and limit opportunities to increase rental rates. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 15.8 .
The Company owns approximately 1.2 million square feet in the Austin and Greater Houston markets. The Austin market has been adversely affected by downturns in the technology industry. Softness in this market has increased competition for tenants, resulting in a reduction in rental rates and increased rent concessions, tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 19.5 which was roughly equivalent to market averages.
In December, 2003, the Company acquired a 3.3 million square foot property located in the Airport West submarket of Miami-Dade County in Florida. The property s vacancy rate upon acquisition was approximately 16.6 , compared to a vacancy rate of approximately 12.7 for the entire submarket. The property is located less than one mile from the cargo entrance of the Miami International Airport, which is recognized as one of the nation s busiest cargo and passenger airports. The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 10.2 .
The Company owns approximately 679,000 square feet in the Phoenix market. Overall, the Phoenix market has been characterized by steady growth. However, average market rental rates have declined over the past several years as demand for space subsided. The vacancy rate in this market is over 8 . The Company s vacancy rate at December 31, 2004 was approximately 6.1 .
Growth of the Company s Operations and Acquisitions and Dispositions of Properties: During 2003 and 2004, the Company focused on maximizing cash flow from its existing core portfolio of properties and through acquisitions and dispositions of properties, expanding its presence in existing and new markets through strategic acquisitions and strengthening its balance sheet, primarily through the issuance of preferred equity. The Company has historically maintained low debt and overall leverage levels through the issuance of preferred equity; this approach is intended to provide the Company with the flexibility for future growth without the need to issue additional common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company acquired a 165,000 square foot office complex in Fairfax, Virginia, for 24.1 million. During 2003, the Company added approximately 4.1 million square feet to its portfolio at an aggregate cost of approximately 282.4 million. The Company acquired 544,000 square feet in Southern California for 60.0 million, 113,000 square feet in Northern Texas for 7.8 million, 3.4 million square feet in Florida for 205.0 million, and 110,000 square feet in Phoenix, Arizona for 9.6 million. During 2002, the Company did not complete any acquisitions. The Company plans to continue to seek to build its presence in existing markets by acquiring high quality facilities in selected markets. The Company targets properties with below market rents which may offer it growth in rental rates above market averages, and which offer the Company the ability to achieve economies of scale resulting in more efficient operations.
In 2004, the Company sold a flex facility in Austin, Texas, for gross proceeds of approximately 1.2 million, a 30,500 square foot building in Beaverton, Oregon for gross proceeds of 3.1 million, a 10,000 and 7,100 square foot unit at MICC, with gross proceeds of 1.9 million and two flex parks totaling approximately 400,000 square feet in Maryland for gross proceeds of approximately 44.2 million. In connection with these sales, the Company reported a gain of 15.5 million
Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company sold two assets previously classified as held for sale. In February, 2005, the Company sold the 56,000 square foot retail center located at MICC for a sales price of approximately 12.2 million. In addition, in January, 2005, the Company closed on the sale of a 7,100 square foot unit at MICC for a gross sales price of 740,000 and closed on the sale of 8.2 acres of land within the Cornell Oaks project in Beaverton, Oregon for a sales price of approximately 3.6 million.
During the first half of 2003, the Company identified a property in Lakewood, California with 57,000 square feet, two buildings in Nashville, Tennessee totaling 138,000 square feet, and five office and flex buildings totaling 342,000 square feet and a 4.5 acre parcel of vacant land in Beaverton, Oregon as assets the Company intended to sell. The sale of Lakewood, California was completed early in the second quarter of 2003 with net proceeds of approximately 6.3 million. The sale of the Nashville properties was completed in June, 2003 with net proceeds of 5.1 million. A gain on the Lakewood and Nashville properties of 3.5 million was recognized in the second quarter of 2003. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company sold a one-acre parcel of land located in Beaverton, Oregon with net proceeds of approximately 733,000. The transaction was completed in July, 2003 at a gain of approximately 14,000. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold a 31,000 square foot flex facility in Beaverton, Oregon with net proceeds of approximately 2.4 million. The transaction was completed in December, 2003 at a loss of approximately 601,000. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company determined that the 342,000 square feet of office flex properties and 3.5 acres of vacant land located in Beaverton, Oregon were not likely to be sold within next twelve months and reclassified such assets into continuing operations.
Impact of Inflation: Although inflation has slowed in recent years, it is still a factor in our economy and the Company continues to seek ways to mitigate its impact. A substantial portion of the Company s leases require tenants to pay operating expenses, including real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance, as well as increases in common area expenses, partially reducing the Company s exposure to inflation.
Concentration of Portfolio by Region: Rental income, cost of operations and rental income less cost of operations, excluding depreciation and amortization or net operating income prior to depreciation and amortization (defined as NOI for purposes of the following tables) from continuing operations are summarized for the year ended December 31, 2004 by major geographic region below. The Company uses NOI and its components as a measurement of the performance of its commercial real estate. Management believes that these financial measures provide them as well as the investor the most consistent measurement on a comparative basis of the performance of the commercial real estate and its contribution to the value of the Company. Depreciation and amortization have been excluded from these financial measures as they are generally not used in determining the value of commercial real estate by management or the investment community. Depreciation and amortization are generally not used in determining value as they consider the historical costs of as asset compared to its current value; therefore, to understand the effect of the assets historical cost on the Company s results, investors should look at GAAP financial measures, such as total operating costs including depreciation and amortization. The Company s calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reflects rental income, operating expenses and NOI from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 based on geographical concentration. The total of all regions is equal to the amount of rental income and cost of operations recorded by the Company in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We have also included the most comparable GAAP measure which includes total depreciation and amortization. The percent of totals by region reflects the actual contribution to rental income, cost of operations and NOI during the period from properties included in continuing operations (in thousands) :

Comparison of 2004 to 2003
Results of Operations: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 62.1 million compared to 49.1 million for year ended December 31, 2003. Net income allocable to common shareholders (net income less preferred stock distributions) for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 29.1 million compared to 33.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net income per common share on a diluted basis was 1.33 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 1.54 for the year ended December 31, 2003 (based on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of 21,960,000 and 21,565,000, respectively). The decrease was due primarily to the increase in preferred equity distributions of 17.2 million partially offset by the increase in income from discontinued operations of 14.0 million including an increase of 12.6 million from gains on disposition of real estate and decrease of impairment losses of 5.9 million.
The Company s property operations account for almost all of the net operating income earned by the Company. The following table presents the operating results of the properties for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in addition to other income and expense items affecting income from continuing operations.

Supplemental Property Data and Trends: In order to evaluate the performance of the Company s overall portfolio over two given years, management analyzes the operating performance of a consistent group of properties owned and operated throughout both those years. The Company refers to those properties as the Same Park facilities. For 2004 and 2003, the Same Park facilities constitute 13.7 million net rentable square feet, include all assets included in continuing operations that the Company owned and operated from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004, and represent approximately 77 of the weighted average square footage of the Company s portfolio for 2004.
Rental income, cost of operations and rental income less cost of operations, excluding depreciation and amortization or net operating income prior to depreciation and amortization (defined as NOI for purposes of the following tables) from continuing operations are summarized for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 by major geographic region below. See Concentration of Portfolio by Region above for more information on NOI, including why the Company presents NOI and how the Company uses NOI. The Company s calculation of NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The following table summarizes the Same Park operating results by major geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The following information provides information regarding the geographical regions in which the Company has operations:
Southern California
This region includes San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles Counties. Rental income and NOI for 2004 were slightly lower than 2003 due to a reduction in weighted average occupancy and greater leasing concessions associated with the properties that were acquired in 2003. Weighted average occupancies have decreased from 95.4 in 2003 to 93.0 in 2004. Realized rent per foot has increased 5.2 from 14.46 per foot for 2003 to 15.21 per foot in 2004. The increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the acquisition properties for all of 2004.
Northern California
This region includes San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento, including 1.0 million square feet in the Silicon Valley, a market that has been devastated by the technology slump. Rental income and NOI decreased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to a restructuring of a lease in the San Jose portfolio. Weighted average occupancies outperformed the market, yet they have decreased from 96.0 in 2003 to 95.0 in 2004. Realized rent per foot has decreased 4.8 from 14.40 per foot for 2003 compared to 13.71 per foot in 2004.
Southern Texas
This region, which includes Austin, is considered one of the Company s challenged markets, and the Company s operating results continue to the effects of sharply reduced market rental rates, higher vacancies and business failures. Weighted average occupancies decreased from 91.8 in 2003 to 83.2 in 2004. Realized rent per foot decreased 12.8 from 11.46 per foot in 2003 to 9.99 per foot in 2004.
Northern Texas
This region includes the Dallas area. The significant reduction in rental income and NOI are due primarily to reduced rents, increased leasing concessions and the loss of certain tenants to bankruptcy or downsizing. Weighted average occupancies have decreased from 93.2 in 2003 to 82.8 in 2004. Realized rent per foot has decreased 9.7 from 11.21 per foot in 2003 to 10.12 per foot in 2004.
Virginia
This region includes all major Northern Virginia suburban submarkets surrounding the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The Washington DC Metro market is considered one of the Company s strongest markets, which is indicated by the significant increase in rental income and NOI. The Company s properties in this market have successfully increased rental rates, reduced leasing concessions, and increased occupancy. Weighted average occupancies have increased from 94.7 in 2003 to 96.1 in 2004. Realized rent per foot has increased 3.0 from 17.15 per foot in 2003 to 17.66 per foot in 2004.
Maryland
This region consists primarily of facilities in Prince Georges County and Montgomery County. While these markets have been relatively stable, weighted average occupancies have increased from 90.4 in 2003 to 91.2 in 2004. Considered part of the Washington DC Metro market, Maryland, like Virginia, has experienced significant increase in rental income and NOI, without proportionate increase in operating expenses. This market has also increased rental rates, reduced concessions, and increased occupancy. Realized rent per foot has increased 5.0 from 20.53 per foot in 2003 to 21.55 per foot in 2004.
Oregon
This region consists primarily of three business parks in the Beaverton submarket of Portland. Oregon has been one of the markets hardest hit by the technology slowdown. The full effect of this slowdown began to take effect in 2003 with lease terminations and expirations resulting in significant declines in rental revenue. During 2004, the market experienced slightly higher levels of leasing activity, with rental rates declining significantly from in-place rents and higher leasing concessions. Weighted average occupancies have decreased from 81.4 in 2003 to 79.1 in 2004. Realized rent per square foot has increased 4.4 from 16.19 per foot in 2003 to 16.90 per foot in 2004.
Facility Management Operations: The Company s facility management operations account for a small portion of the Company s net income. During the year ended December 31, 2004, 624,000 of revenue was recognized from facility management fees compared to 742,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Cost of Operations: Cost of operations, excluding discontinued operations, was 65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is due primarily to the growth in the square footage of the Company s portfolio of properties. Cost of
operations as a percentage of rental income increased from 27.5 in 2003 to 29.7 in 2004. Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted mainly of the following items: property taxes 19.9 million); property maintenance 14.7 million); utilities 11.7 million); and direct payroll 10.5 million) as compared to cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 which consisted of the following items: property taxes 16.6 million); property maintenance 13.1 million); utilities 9.5 million); and direct payroll 8.0 million).
Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation and amortization expense was 72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is primarily due to depreciation expense on real estate facilities acquired in 2004 and at the end of 2003.
General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expense was 4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 consisted mainly of the following items: expenses which relate to the accounting, finance, and executive divisions of the Company, which primarily consist of payroll expenses 2.4 million); professional fees, including expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 SOX 404 Compliance, outside accounting, tax, legal and investor services 1.3 million); expenses which relate to issuances and exercises of stock options and restricted stock 93,000); and other various expenses.

During 2004, the Company incurred approximately 600,000 related to its efforts to ensure compliance with SOX 404. While management expects that the ongoing costs of ensuring compliance with SOX 404 will be lower in future periods, such amount cannot be determined at this point. Management also anticipates slightly higher levels of salary and related costs resulting from the changes to the Company s senior management team.
Interest and Other Income: Interest and other income reflects earnings on cash balances and dividends on marketable securities in addition to miscellaneous income items. Interest and other income was 406,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily related to interest earned on cash balances which generally earned less than 2 interest.

In addition to interest on cash on hand, during 2003 interest and other income also included approximately 400,000 of construction management fees.
Interest Expense: Interest expense was 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to the pay down on the line of credit, notes payable and declining mortgage balances as a result of the preferred equity issued in 2004. No interest expense was capitalized as part of building costs associated with properties under development during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.
Equity in Income of Discontinued Joint Venture: Equity in income of discontinued joint venture reflects the Company s share of net income from its joint venture. Equity in income of discontinued joint venture was 0 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2.3 million for the same period in 2003. The decrease is due to the joint venture being liquidated in 2003.
Gain on Disposition of Real Estate: Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations are gains on dispositions of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 of 15.5 million compared to 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In 2004, the Company disposed of 6 properties, two in Maryland, two in Miami, one in Texas and one in Oregon. The two properties in Maryland generated a gain of 15.2 million with the remaining 4 properties providing a net gain of approximately 300,000. During the year ended
December 31, 2003 the Company disposed of three properties, one in Lakewood and two in Nashville for a gain of 3.2 million and 300,000, respectively. A property in Beaverton was sold during the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in a loss of approximately 601,000.
Impairment Charge: There was no impairment charge recognized during the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations is an impairment charge of 5.9 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2003 specific to five office and flex buildings and a 4.5 acre parcel of land in Beaverton, Oregon.
Minority Interest in Income: Minority interest in income reflects the income allocable to equity interests in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by the Company. Minority interest in income was 30.0 million 20.2 million allocated to preferred unitholders and 9.8 million allocated to common unitholders) for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 30.6 million 19.2 million allocated to preferred unitholders and 11.3 million allocated to common unitholders) for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in minority interest in income is due primarily to the redemptions of preferred operating partnership units during 2004.
Comparison of 2003 to 2002
Results of Operations: Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 49.1 million compared to 57.4 million for the same period in 2002. Net income allocable to common shareholders (net income less preferred stock distributions) for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 33.3 million compared to 42.0 million for the same period in 2002. Net income per common share on a diluted basis was 1.54 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2002 (based on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of 21,565,000 and 21,743,000, respectively). The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in gains on disposition of real estate and marketable securities of 4.1 million, an increase in impairment losses of 5.0 million and a reduction in Same Park results of 869,000.
The Company s property operations account for almost all of the net operating income earned by the Company. The following table presents the operating results of the properties for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 in addition to other income and expense items affecting income from continuing operations.

The following information provides information regarding the geographical regions in which the Company has operations:
Southern California
This region includes San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles Counties.

Weighted average occupancies have decreased from 97.5 in 2002 to 95.4 in 2003. Realized rent per foot has increased 5.0 from 13.77 per foot for 2002 to 14.46 per foot in 2003.
Northern California
This region includes San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento, including 1,025,000 square feet in the Silicon Valley, a market that has been devastated by the technology slump. The Company benefited from the early renewal of large leases in its Silicon Valley portfolio and relative strength in the Sacramento market. Weighted average occupancies outperformed the market, yet they have decreased from 97.1 in 2002 to 96.0 in 2003. Realized rent per foot has decreased 1.0 from 14.55 per foot for 2002 compared to 14.40 per foot in 2003.
Southern Texas
This region, which includes Austin, was among the hardest hit due to the technology slump and the Company s operating results are showing the effects of sharply reduced market rental rates, higher vacancies and business failures. Weighted average occupancies were the same at 91.8 in 2002 and 2003. Realized rent per foot decreased 3.2 from 11.84 per foot in 2002 to 11.46 per foot in 2003.

Virginia
This region includes all major Northern Virginia suburban submarkets surrounding the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Virginia has been negatively impacted in the Chantilly and Herndon submarkets as a result of the technology and telecommunications industry slowdown. Other submarkets have been positively impacted by increased federal government spending on defense. Weighted average occupancies have increased from 90.8 in 2002 to 94.7 in 2003. Realized rent per foot has increased 1.5 from 16.90 per foot in 2002 to 17.15 per foot in 2003.
Maryland
This region consists primarily of facilities in Prince Georges County and Montgomery County. While these markets have been relatively stable, weighted average occupancies have decreased from 94.3 in 2002 to 90.4 in 2003, partially as a result of some unexpected lease terminations. Realized rent per foot has increased 10.9 from 18.52 per foot in 2002 to 20.53 per foot in 2003.
Oregon
This region consists primarily of three business parks in the Beaverton submarket of Portland. Oregon has been one of the markets hardest hit by the technology slowdown. The full effect of this slowdown began to take effect in 2003 with lease terminations and expirations resulting in significant declines in rental revenue. Weighted average occupancies have decreased from 90.9 in 2002 to 81.4 in 2003. Realized rent per foot has decreased 2.9 from 16.68 per foot in 2002 to 16.19 per foot in 2003.

Cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 consisted mainly of the following items: property taxes 16.6 million); property maintenance 13.1 million); utilities 9.5 million); and direct payroll 8.0 million) as compared to cost of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 which consisted of the following items: property taxes 16.4 million); property maintenance 12.0 million); utilities 9.2 million); and direct payroll 8.6 million).
Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation and amortization expense was 57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily due to depreciation expense on real estate facilities acquired in 2003.
General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expense was 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease is mainly due to a line of credit extension fee incurred in 2002 with no corresponding expense for 2003. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 consisted mainly of the following items: expenses which relate to the accounting, finance, and executive divisions of the Company, which primarily consist of payroll expenses 1.9 million); internal acquisitions costs 585,000); professional fees, including expenses related to outside accounting, tax, legal and investor services 773,000); expenses which relate to issuances and exercises of stock options and restricted stock 852,000); and other various expenses.

Interest Expense: Interest expense was 4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances in 2003 due to a higher average balance on the line of credit in 2002, and declining mortgage balances, offset by a reduction of capitalized interest. Interest expense of 0 and 288,000 was capitalized as part of building costs associated with properties under development during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Equity in Income of Discontinued Joint Venture: Equity in income of discontinued joint venture reflects the Company s share of net income from its joint venture. Equity in income of discontinued joint venture was 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2.0 million for the same period in 2002. The increase in 2003 is due to the gain on sale of the remaining six buildings in the joint venture of 1.4 million and additional income for meeting performance measures of 920,000.
Gain on Disposition of Real Estate: Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations are gains on dispositions of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 of 2.9 million compared to 9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was 152.0 million and 132.4 million, respectively.

Net cash used in investing activities was 26.1 million and 294.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The change between years was 268.8 million or 91.1 due to the composition of the activity being very different from 2003 to 2004. Cash paid for acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 22.3 million compared to 279.1 million in the prior year. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 the Company used 52.1 million and 38.9 million for capital improvements to real estate facilities, respectively. The increase of 13.2 million or 33.9 resulted from increased transaction costs related to higher level of leasing activity combined with increased competition for tenants throughout the portfolio. As the Company has experienced increased competition from the landlords it has had to increase the level of tenant improvements provided to new tenants.
Net cash used in financing activities was 92.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 123.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company repaid or refinanced 576.9 million of debt and preferred equity during the period while it received 560.7 million from preferred equity offerings and short term borrowings during the same period. As a result of these transactions, the Company increased its preferred equity outstanding to 33 of its market capitalization at December 31, 2004 from 21 at December 31, 2003 and decreased the outstanding debt from 14 of its market capitalization at December 31, 2003 to 1 at December 31, 2004. Additionally, the Company had paid
preferred shareholders 31.2 million in distributions for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The Company s capital structure is characterized by a low level of leverage. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had two fixed rate mortgage notes payable totaling 11.4 million, which represented approximately 1 of its total capitalization (based on book value, including minority interest and debt). The weighted average interest rate for the mortgage notes is approximately 7.73 per annum. The Company had approximately 1.3 of its properties, in terms of net book value, encumbered at December 31, 2004.
The Company has an unsecured line of credit (the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, with a borrowing limit of 100.0 million and an expiration date of August 1, 2005. Interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly. At the option of the Company, the rate of interest charged is equal to (i) the prime rate or (ii) a rate ranging from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 0.60 to LIBOR plus 1.20 depending on the Company s credit ratings and coverage ratios, as defined (currently LIBOR plus 0.70 ). In addition, the Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee ranging from 0.20 to 0.35 of the borrowing limit (currently 0.25 ). The Company had drawn 0 and 95.0 million on its line of credit at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company repaid in full the 95.0 million outstanding on its line of credit in January, 2004, and subsequently, borrowed 138.0 million on its line of credit in 2004 which was repaid in full prior to December 31, 2004.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had 100.0 million in short-term borrowings from PSI. The note bore interest at 1.4 and was due on March 9, 2004. The Company repaid the note in full during the first quarter of 2004.
In February 2002, the Company entered into a seven year 50.0 million term loan agreement with Fleet National Bank. The interest on the note was at LIBOR plus 1.45 and it had an original maturity of February 20, 2009. The Company paid a one-time fee of 0.35 or 175,000 for the facility. In July 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction which had the effect of fixing the rate on the term loan through July 2004 at 4.46 per annum. In February 2004, the Company repaid in full the 50.0 million outstanding on the term loan.
The Company used its short-term borrowing capacity to complete acquisitions totaling approximately 282.4 million in 2003. The Company borrowed 95.0 million from its line of credit and 100.0 million from PSI. The remaining balance was funded with cash from operations.
During 2004, the Company issued an aggregate of 437.8 million of preferred equity with an average rate of 7.23 . Proceeds from the various offerings were used to redeem higher rate preferred equity aggregating 185.6 million with an average rate of 8.93 . In addition, proceeds were used to provide permanent financing for the Company s acquisitions made in 2003 and 2004 by enabling the Company to repay in full the balances outstanding on the Company s note with PSI, the Credit Facility and the term loan.
During May, 2003 and September, 2003, the Company repurchased 7,300 and 78,300 depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000 of a share of Series A preferred stock at 26.00 and 25.65 per depositary share, for 190,000 and 2.0 million, respectively. The stated value of the stock was 25 per depository share. The premium and original issuance costs were recorded as an additional distribution to preferred shareholders. The aggregate effect was a reduction of 127,000 of net income and funds from operations allocable to common shareholders and unitholders.
During January 2002, the Company issued 2,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000 of a share of 8.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F, resulting in net proceeds of 48.3 million. This was used to repay 35.0 million borrowed from PSI in 2001 and to increase financial flexibility.
During October, 2002, the Operating Partnership completed a private placement of 800,000 preferred units with a preferred distribution rate of 7.95 . The net proceeds from the placement of preferred units were approximately 19.5 million.
The Company s funding strategy has been to use permanent capital, including common and preferred stock, and internally generated retained cash flows. In addition, the Company may sell properties that no
longer meet its investment criteria. The Company may finance acquisitions on a temporary basis with borrowings from its Credit Facility. The Company targets a ratio of Funds from Operations FFO to combined fixed charges and preferred distributions of 3.0 to 1.0. Fixed charges include interest expense and capitalized interest. Preferred distributions include amounts paid to preferred shareholders and preferred Operating Partnership unitholders. As of the year ended December 31, 2004, the FFO to fixed charges and preferred distributions coverage ratio was 3.0 to 1.0, excluding the effects of EITF Topic D-42.
Non-GAAP Supplemental Disclosure Measure: Funds from Operations: Management believes that Funds From Operations FFO is a useful supplemental measure of the Company s operating performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), before depreciation, amortization, minority interest in income, and extraordinary items. Management believes that FFO provides a useful measure of the Company s operating performance and when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
FFO should be analyzed in conjunction with net income. However, FFO should not be viewed as a substitute for net income as a measure of operating performance or liquidity as it does not reflect depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditure and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company s properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact the Company s results from operations.
Management believes FFO provides useful information to the investment community about the Company s operating performance when compared to the performance of other real estate companies as FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting operations of real estate investment trusts REIT ). Other REITs may use different methods for calculating FFO and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to other real estate companies.

FFO for the year ended December 31, 2004 included non-cash distributions of 5.0 million related to the application of EITF Topic D-42 and the redemption of 185.6 million of preferred equity completed in 2004. FFO for the same period of 2003 included a non-cash impairment charge related to
the previously anticipated sale of assets in Beaverton, Oregon. Excluding these non-cash adjustments, the changes in FFO relate to a reduction in the Same Park operating results of approximately 4.5 million, partially offset by contributions from Other Facilities in 2003 as well as a reduction in fixed charges related to the refinancing of preferred equity.
Capital Expenditures: During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred approximately 45.8 million and 23.0 million, respectively, in recurring capital expenditures or 2.45 and 1.61 per weighted average square foot, respectively. The Company defines recurring capital expenditures as those necessary to maintain and operate its commercial real estate at its current economic value. The Company expects the higher levels of transactions to continue into 2005 as a result of competition in difficult markets. The following depicts actual capital expenditures for the stated periods: (in thousands)

Stock Repurchase: The Company s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to 4,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company did not repurchase any shares during 2004. In 2003, the Company repurchased 261,200 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 8.1 million or 31.08 per share. Since the inception of the program (March 2000), the Company has repurchased an aggregate total of 2,621,711 shares of common stock and 30,484 common units in its operating partnership at an aggregate cost of approximately 70.7 million (average cost of 26.66 per share/unit).
Redemption of Preferred Stock: On April 30, 2004 the Company redeemed 2.1 million depositary shares of its 9 1 / 4 Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A for approximately 52.8 million. In accordance with EITF Topic D-42, the redemption resulted in a reduction of net income allocable to common shareholders of approximately 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 equal to the excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount of the redeemed securities.
On April 23, 2004 the Company redeemed 510,000 units of its 8.875 Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Operating Partnership Units for approximately 12.8 million. Additionally, on September 3, 2004, the Operating Partnership redeemed 3.2 million units of its 8.75 Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for 80.0 million. Further, on September 7, 2004, the Operating Partnership redeemed 1.6 million units of its 8.875 Series X Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units for 40.0 million. In accordance with EITF D-42, the redemptions resulted in a reduction of net income allocable to common shareholders of approximately 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and a corresponding increase in the allocation of income to preferred minority interests equal to the excess of the redemption amount over the carrying amount of the redeemed securities.
Distributions: The Company has elected and intends to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to maintain its status as a REIT, the Company must meet, among other tests, sources of income, share ownership and certain asset tests. As a REIT, the Company is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders provided that at least 90 of its taxable income is distributed to its shareholders prior to filing of its tax return.
Related Party Transactions: At December 31, 2004, PSI owns 24.8 of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock (43.7 upon conversion of its interest in the Operating Partnership) and 25.1 of the outstanding common units of the Operating Partnership (100 of the common units not owned by the Company). Ronald L. Havner, Jr., the Company s chairman, is also the vice-chairman, chief executive officer and a director of PSI.
Pursuant to a cost sharing and administrative services agreement, the Company shares costs with PSI and affiliated entities for certain administrative services. These costs totaled 327,000 in 2004 and are allocated among PSI and its affiliates in accordance with a methodology intended to fairly allocate those costs. In addition, the Company provides property management services for properties owned by PSI and its affiliates for a fee of 5 of the gross revenues of such properties in addition to reimbursement of direct costs. These management fee revenues recognized under management contracts with affiliated parties totaled approximately 562,000 in 2004.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had 100.0 million in short-term borrowings from PSI. The note bore interest at 1.4 and was due on March 9, 2004. The Company repaid the note in full during the first quarter of 2004.

---------- Risk Chunk 1 ----------
Item 1A.
Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in or incorporated by reference into our Form 10-K, as part of your evaluation of the Company. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment .
Our Acquisitions May Not Perform as A nticipated
We have completed many acquisitions of self-storage facilities since our initial public offering of common stock in June 1995. Our strategy is to continue to grow by acquiring additional self-storage facilities. Acquisitions entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with our expectations and that our judgments with respect to the prices paid for acquired properties and the costs of any improvements required to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property will prove inaccurate. Acquisitions also involve general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment.
We May Incur Problems With Our Real Estate F inancing
Unsecured Credit Facility . We have a line of credit with a syndicate of financial institutions, which are our "lenders." This unsecured credit facility is recourse to us and the required payments are not reduced if the economic performance of any of the properties declines. The unsecured credit facility limits our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, except for distributions required by the real estate investment trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we refer to as the "Code" and in other limited circumstances. If there is an event of default, our lenders may seek to exercise their rights under the unsecured credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make expected distributions to shareholders.
Rising Interest Rates . Indebtedness that we incur under the unsecured credit facility bears interest at a variable rate. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could increase our interest expense, which would reduce our cash available for distribution and our ability to pay expected distributions to our shareholders. We manage our exposure to rising interest rates using interest rate swaps and other available mechanisms. If the amount of our indebtedness bearing interest at a variable rate increases, our unsecured credit facility may require us to use those arrangements.
Refinancing May Not Be Available . It may be necessary for us to refinance our unsecured credit facility through additional debt financing or equity offerings. If we were unable to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms, we might be forced to dispose of some of our properties upon disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us and might adversely affect the cash available for distribution. If prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates on refinancings, our interest expense would increase, which would adversely affect our cash available for distribution and our ability to pay expected distributions to shareholders.
Our Debt Levels May I ncrease
Our Board of Directors currently has a policy of limiting the amount of our debt at the time of incurrence to less than 50 of the sum of the market value of our issued and outstanding common stock and preferred stock plus the amount of our debt including the debt proposed to be incurred. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness we might incur. Accordingly, our Board of Directors could alter or eliminate the current policy limitation on borrowing without a vote of our shareholders. We could become highly leveraged if this policy were changed. However, our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank credit arrangements and in our securities purchase agreement with holders of our Series C preferred stock.
We are Subject to The Risks Posed by Fluctuating Demand and Significant Competition in the Self-Storage I ndustry
Our properties are subject to all operating risks common to the self-storage industry. These risks include but are not limited to the following:
-
Decreases in demand for rental spaces in a particular locale;
- -
Changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing facilities in an area;
- -
Changes in market rental rates; and
- -

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
Inability to collect rents from customers.
Our current strategy is to acquire interests only in self-storage facilities. Consequently, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. Our Properties compete with other self-storage facilities in their geographic markets. As a result of competition, the Properties could experience a decrease in occupancy levels and rental rates, which would decrease our cash available for distribution. We compete in operations and for acquisition opportunities with companies that have substantial financial resources. Competition may reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities offered to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. The self-storage industry has at times experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. A recurrence of overbuilding might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to increase rents and compel u s to offer discounted rents.
Our Real Estate Investments are Illiquid and are Subject to Uninsurable Risks and Government Regulations
General Risks . Our investments are subject to varying degrees of risk generally related to the ownership of real property. The underlying value of our real estate investments and our income and ability to make distributions to our shareholders are dependent upon our ability to operate the properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase cash available for distribution. Income from our properties may be adversely affected by the following factors:
- -
Changes in national economic conditions;
- -
Changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics;
- -
Competition from other self-storage facilities;
- -
Changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage funds;
- -
The impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws;
- -
The ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older facilities;
- -
Changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses;
- -
Adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies;
- -
Uninsured losses resulting from casualties associated with severe weather conditions, civil unrest, acts of God, including natural disasters, and acts of war;
- -
Adverse changes in zoning laws; and
- -

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
Other factors that are beyond our control.
Illiquidity of Real Estate May Limit its Value . Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions is limited. In addition, provisions of the Code may limit our ability to profit on the sale of properties held for fewer than four years. We may be unable to dispose of a property when we find disposition advantageous or necessary and the sale price of any disposition may not equal or exceed the amount of our investment.
Uninsured and Underinsured Losses Could Reduce the Value of our Properties . Some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, that we potentially face with respect to our properties may be uninsurable or not insurable at an acceptable cost. For example, in 2004, our income was adversely affected by uninsured losses resulting from four hurricanes that hit the Eastern United States. Our management uses its discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to acquiring appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. These decisions may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and oth er factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under those circumstances, the insurance proceeds received by us might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to a particular property.
Possible Liability Relating to Environmental Matters . Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that property. Those laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not cause or know of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and even if the storage of those substances was in violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure of the owner to address their presence on the property, may adversely affect the owner's ability to borrow using that real property as collateral. In connection with the ownership of the properties, we may be potentially liable for any of those costs.
Americans with Disabilities Act . The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, generally requires that buildings be made accessible to persons with disabilities. A determination that we are not in compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. If we were required to make modifications to comply with the ADA, our results of operations and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected.
There are Limitations on the Ability to Change Control of S ovran
Limitation on Ownership and Transfer of Shares . To maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code. To limit the possibility that we will fail to qualify as a REIT under this test, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation include ownership limits and transfer restrictions on shares of our capital stock. Our Articles of Incorporation limit ownership of our issued and outstanding capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.8 of the aggregate value of our outstanding capital stock, except that the ownership by some of our shareholders is limited to 15 .
These ownership limits may:
-
Have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control of Sovran by a third party without consent of our Board of Directors even if the change in control would be in the interest of shareholders, and
- -
Limit the opportunity for shareholders to receive a premium for shares of our common stock they hold that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of common stock in excess of 9.8 or 15 , as the case may be, of the outstanding shares of our capital stock or to otherwise effect a change in control of Sovran.
Our Board of Directors may waive the ownership limits if it is satisfied that ownership by those shareholders in excess of those limits will not jeopardize our status as a REIT under the Code or in the event it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to be a REIT. Waivers have been granted to the holders of our Series C preferred stock. A transfer of our common stock and/or preferred stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limits may not be effective under some circumstances.
Shareholder Rights Plan . We have a shareholder rights plan that grants the holders of our common stock rights that generally become exercisable if a person:
-
Becomes an "acquiring person" by acquiring 10 or more of our outstanding common stock, or
- -

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
Commences a tender offer that would result in that person owning 10 or more of our outstanding common stock.
The shareholder rights plan generally provides that the initial holders of our Series C preferred stock are not considered acquiring persons by reason of their purchase from us of the Series C preferred stock or other related acquisitions, if those acquisitions are not made with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of Sovran. In the event a person becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a right (other than the acquiring person) would be entitled to acquire a number of shares of our Series A junior preferred stock that are equivalent to the shares of our common stock having a value of twice the then-current exercise price of the right. If we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after that event, each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company's common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. Our shareholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Sovran.
Other Limitations . Other limitations could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some, or a majority, of our outstanding common stock might receive a premium for their shares of our common stock that exceeds the then prevailing market price or that those holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interest. The issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Sovran even if a change in control were in the shareholders' interest. In addition, the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, imposes restrictions and requires that specified procedures be followed with respect to the acquisition of stated levels of share ownership and business combinations, including combinations with interested shareholders. These provisions of the MGCL could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in co ntrol of Sovran even if a change in control were in the shareholders' interest. Waivers and exemptions have been granted to the initial purchasers of our Series C preferred stock in connection with these provisions of the MGCL. In addition, under the Operating Partnership's agreement of limited partnership, in general, we may not merge, consolidate or engage in any combination with another person or sell all or substantially all of our assets unless that transaction includes the merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating Partnership, which requires the approval of the holders of 75 of the limited partnership interests thereof. If we were to own less than 75 of the limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, this provision of the limited partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing us from engaging in some change of control transactions.
Our Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Have Adverse C onsequences
We intend to operate in a matter that will permit us to qualify as a REIT under the Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. Continued qualification as a REIT depends upon our continuing ability to meet various requirements concerning, among other things, the ownership of our outstanding stock, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be ineligible for qualification as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which our qualification was lost. As a result, distributions to the shareholders would be reduced for each of the years involved. Although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke our REIT election.
Market Interests Rates May Influence the Price of our Common Stock
One of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock is the annual yields on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments. An increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
Regional Concentration of our Business May Subject us to Economic Downturns in the States of Texas and Florida.
At December 31, 2004, 107 of our 271 self-storage facilities are located in the States of Texas and Florida. For the year ended December 31, 2004, these facilities accounted for approximately 42 of our total revenues. This concentration of business in Texas and Florida exposes us to potential losses resulting from a downturn in the economies of those states. If economic conditions in those states deteriorate, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Implementation of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 May Adversely Affect the Value of Our Common S tock
On May 28, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act of 2003, which provides favorable income tax rates for certain corporate dividends received by individuals through December 31, 2008. Under this new law, REIT dividends are not eligible for the preferential capital gain rates applicable to dividends unless the dividends are attributable to income that has been subject to corporate-level tax. As a result, substantially all of the distributions paid on shares of our stock are not expected to qualify for those lower rates. This new law could cause stock in non-REIT corporations to be more attractive to investors relative to stock in REITs, which may negatively affect the value of, and the market for, our common stock.
Terrorist Attacks and the Possibility of Armed Conflict May Have an Adverse Effect On Our Business, Financial Condition and Operating Results and Could Decrease the Value of Our A ssets
Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, such as those that took place on September 11, 2001, or the recent war with Iraq, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There may be further terrorist attacks against the United States. Attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of our properties could significantly affect our ability to operate those properties and, as a result, impair our ability to achieve our expected results. Furthermore, we may not have insurance coverage for losses caused by a terrorist attack. That insurance may not be available or, if it is available and we decide, or are required by our lenders, to obtain terrorism coverage, the cost for the insurance may be significant in relationship to the risk covered. In addition, the adverse effects terrorist acts and threats of future attacks could have on the U.S. economy could similarly have a ma terial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, further terrorist acts could cause the United States to enter into armed conflict, which could further impact our business, financial and operating results.

RISK FACTORS
Risks Related to the Mining Industry Generally
Risks Related to Newmont Operations
11 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Every investor or potential investor in Newmont should carefully consider the following risks, which have been separated into two groups:
Risks related to the mining industry generally; and
Risks related to Newmont s operations. Risks Related to the Mining Industry Generally A Substantial or Extended Decline in Gold or Copper Prices Would Have a Material Adverse Effect on Newmont Newmont s business is dependent on the prices of gold and copper, which are affected by numerous factors beyond Newmont s control. Factors tending to put downward pressure on the prices of gold and copper include:
Sales or leasing of gold by governments and central banks;
A strong U.S. dollar;
Global and regional recession or reduced economic activity;
Speculative trading;
Decreased demand for industrial uses, use in jewelry or investment;
High supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;
Sales by producers in forward transactions and other hedging transactions; and
Devaluing local currencies (relative to gold priced in U.S. dollars) leading to lower production costs and higher production in certain regions. Any drop in the prices of gold or copper adversely impacts our revenues, profits and cash flows, particularly in light of our philosophy of avoiding gold hedging. Newmont has recorded asset write-downs in prior years as a result of low gold prices and may experience additional asset impairments as a result of low gold or copper prices in the future. In addition, sustained low gold or copper prices can:
Reduce revenues further through production cutbacks due to cessation of the mining of deposits or portions of deposits that have become uneconomic at the then-prevailing gold or copper price;
Halt or delay the development of new projects;
Reduce funds available for exploration, with the result that depleted reserves are not replaced; and/or
Reduce existing reserves, by removing ores from reserves that cannot be economically mined or treated at prevailing prices. Also see the discussion in Item 1, Business, Gold or Copper Price.
Table of Contents
Gold and Copper Producers Must Continually Obtain Additional Reserves Gold and copper producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production. Depleted reserves must be replaced by expanding known ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order for producers to maintain production levels over the long term. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and frequently is unproductive. No assurances can be given that any of our new or ongoing exploration programs will result in new mineral producing operations. Once mineralization is discovered, it may take many years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Estimates of Proven and Probable Reserves Are Uncertain Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques. Producers use feasibility studies to derive estimates of operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility, equipment, operating costs, and other factors. Actual operating costs and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phase of drilling before production is possible and, during that time, the economic feasibility of exploiting a discovery may change. Increased Costs Could Affect Profitability Costs at any particular mining location frequently are subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on Newmont s profitability. Mining Accidents or Other Adverse Events at a Mining Location Could Reduce Our Production Levels At any of Newmont s operations, production may fall below historic or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents such as a pit wall failure in an open pit mine, or cave-ins or flooding at underground mines. In addition, production may be unexpectedly reduced at a location if, during the course of mining, unfavorable ground conditions or seismic activity are encountered; ore grades are lower than expected; the physical or metallurgical characteristics of the ore are less amenable to mining or treatment than expected; or our equipment, processes or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected. Mining Companies Are Subject to Extensive Environmental Laws and Regulations Newmont s exploration, mining and processing operations are regulated in all countries in which we operate under various federal, state, provincial and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, which generally include air and water quality, hazardous waste management and reclamation. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals may adversely impact our operations. The regulatory environment in which Newmont operates could change in ways that would substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on Newmont s operations or financial position. For a more detailed discussion of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters, Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 10

Risks Related to Newmont Operations Our Operations Outside North America and Australia Are Subject to Risks of Doing Business Abroad Exploration, development and production activities outside of North America and Australia are potentially subject to political and economic risks, including:
Cancellation or renegotiation of contracts;
Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
Changes in foreign laws or regulations;
Royalty and tax increases or claims by governmental entities, including retroactive claims;
Expropriation or nationalization of property;
Currency fluctuations (particularly in countries with high inflation);
Foreign exchange controls;
Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;
Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold;
Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore;
Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;
Risk of loss due to disease and other potential endemic health issues; and
Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted. Consequently, Newmont s exploration, development and production activities outside of North America and Australia may be substantially affected by factors beyond Newmont s control, any of which could materially adversely affect Newmont s financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from such activities, Newmont may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside North America or Australia, which could adversely affect the outcome of a dispute. Newmont has substantial investments in Indonesia, a nation that since 1997 has undergone financial crises and devaluation of its currency, outbreaks of political and religious violence, changes in national leadership, and the secession of East Timor, one of its former provinces. These factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. If this were to occur with respect to the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, Newmont s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In July 2004, a criminal complaint was filed against P.T. Newmont Minahasa Raya PTNMR ), the Newmont subsidiary that operated the Minahasa mine in Indonesia, alleging environmental pollution relating to submarine tailings placement into nearby Buyat Bay. The Indonesian police detained five PTNMR employees during September and October of 2004. The police investigation and the detention of PTNMR s employees was declared illegal by the South Jakarta District Court in December of 2004, and the police have appealed that decision to the Indonesian Supreme Court. A civil lawsuit, which was filed by three residents of Buyat Pante, a village located near the Minahasa mine, was settled without payment to the plaintiffs in December 2004. In addition, on March 9, 2005, the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment reportedly filed a civil lawsuit against PTNMR and its President Director in relation to these allegations. Independent sampling and testing of Buyat Bay water and fish, as well as area residents, conducted by the World Health Organization and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization,
Table of Contents
confirm that PTNMR has not polluted the Buyat Bay environment, and, therefore, has not adversely affected the fish in the Bay or the health of nearby residents. The Company remains steadfast that it has not caused pollution or health problems and will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. However, Newmont cannot predict the outcome of these actions or whether additional legal actions may occur. Any of these actions could adversely affect our ability to operate in Indonesia. During the last several years, Minera Yanacocha, of which Newmont owns a 51.35 interest, has been the target of numerous local political protests, including ones that blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine complex and the city of Cajamarca in Peru. During September 2004, individuals from the Cajamarca region conducted a sustained blockade of the road in protest of drilling activities at Cerro Quilish, one of the ore deposits within the Yanacocha mine complex. Yanacocha suspended all drilling activities at Cerro Quilish, and the blockade was resolved. At the request of Yanacocha, the Cerro Quilish drilling permit was revoked in November 2004. Newmont has reassessed the challenges involved in obtaining required permits for Cerro Quilish primarily related to increased community concerns. Based upon this reassessment, Newmont has reclassified the deposit s 1.98 million equity gold ounces from proven and probable reserves to mineralized material not in reserves as of December 31, 2004. We cannot predict whether these incidents will continue, nor can we predict the government s continuing positions on foreign investment, mining concessions, land tenure, environmental regulation or taxation. The continuation or intensification of protests or a change in prior governmental positions could adversely affect operations in Peru. Recent violence committed by radical elements in Indonesia and other countries, and the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, may increase the risk that operations owned by U.S. companies will be the target of further violence. If any of Newmont s operations were so targeted it could have an adverse effect on our business. Our Success May Depend on Our Social and Environmental Performance Newmont s ability to operate successfully in communities around the world will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the health and safety of our employees, the protection of the environment, and the creation of long-term economic and social opportunities in the communities in which we operate. Newmont has implemented a management system designed to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance and community relations. However, our ability to operate may be adversely impacted by accidents or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate. Remediation Costs for Environmental Liabilities May Exceed the Provisions We Have Made Newmont has conducted extensive remediation work at two inactive sites in the United States. At one of these sites, remediation requirements have not been finally determined, and, therefore, the final cost cannot be determined. At a third site in the United States, an inactive uranium mine and mill formerly operated by a subsidiary of Newmont, remediation work at the mill is ongoing, but remediation at the mine is subject to dispute and has not yet commenced. The environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at this site remain uncertain and there is a risk that the costs of remediation may exceed the provision that has been made for such remediation by a material amount. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known or a previously estimated cost is increased, the amount of that liability or additional cost can materially reduce net income in that period. The Use of Hedging Instruments May Prevent Gains Being Realized from Subsequent Price Increases Newmont does not intend to enter into material new gold hedging positions and intends to continue to decrease gold hedge positions over time by opportunistically delivering gold into our existing hedge contracts, or
Table of Contents
by seeking to eliminate our hedge position when economically attractive. Nonetheless, Newmont currently has gold hedging positions and may, from time-to-time, enter into hedge contracts for copper, other metals or commodities, interest rates or foreign currencies. In 2004, Newmont entered into copper hedging positions covering approximately 459 million pounds of copper. If the gold, copper or other metal price rises above the price at which future production has been committed under these hedge instruments, Newmont will have an opportunity loss. However, if the gold, copper or other metal price falls below that committed price, Newmont s revenues will be protected to the extent of such committed production. In addition, we may experience losses if a hedge counterparty defaults under a contract when the contract price exceeds the gold, copper or other metal price. For a more detailed description of the Newmont hedge positions, see the discussion in Hedging in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Currency Fluctuations May Affect Costs Currency fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur at our operations. Gold is sold throughout the world based principally on the U.S. dollar price, but a portion of Newmont s operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the U.S. dollar can increase the costs of gold production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States, making such mines less profitable. The currencies that primarily impact Newmont s results of operations are the Australian and Canadian dollars. During 2004, the Australian and Canadian dollars strengthened by an average of 13 and 7 , respectively, against the U.S. dollar. This increased U.S. dollar reported operating costs in Australia and Canada by approximately 56.6 million and 4.8 million, respectively. For additional information, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Results of Operations, Foreign Currency Exchange Rates, below. For a more detailed description of how currency exchange rates may affect costs, see discussion in Foreign Currency in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our Level of Indebtedness May Affect Our Business As of December 31, 2004, Newmont had debt of 1.6 billion, as compared to 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2003. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for our operations, including:
Newmont may need to use a large portion of its cash flow to repay principal and pay interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of funds available to finance our operations and other business activities;
Newmont s debt level may make us vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in Newmont s businesses and markets; and
Newmont s debt level may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow money for operations or capital expenditures in the future or implement our business strategy. Newmont expects to be able to pay principal and interest on our debt by utilizing cash flow from operations and Newmont s ability to meet these payment obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. Newmont will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets in which Newmont operates. Newmont cannot be certain that our future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If cash flow from operations is insufficient, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, utilize existing cash balances, borrow more money or issue additional equity. We cannot be sure that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 13
Table of Contents
Our Interest in the Batu Hijau Mine in Indonesia May Be Reduced Under the Contract of Work Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work with the Indonesian government, beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2010, a portion of each foreign shareholders equity interest in the project must be offered for sale to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals. The price at which such interest must be offered for sale to the Indonesian parties is the highest of the then-current replacement cost, the price at which shares of the project company would be accepted for listing on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, or the fair market value of such interest in the project company as a going concern. An Indonesian national currently owns a 20 interest in Batu Hijau, which would require Newmont and Sumitomo, collectively, to offer a 3 interest to the Indonesian government or to Indonesian nationals in 2006. Pursuant to this provision of the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, it is possible that the ownership interest of the Newmont/Sumitomo partnership in Batu Hijau could be reduced to 49 by the end of 2010. Occurrence of Events for Which We Are Not Insured May Affect Our Cash Flow and Overall Profitability We maintain insurance policies to protect ourselves against certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe to be reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, Newmont may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. Some concern always exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crisis are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation and a unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. Newmont does not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which Newmont is not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability. Our Business Depends on Good Relations with Our Employees Newmont could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2004, unions represented approximately 20 of our worldwide work force. On that date, Newmont had 1,098 employees at its Carlin, Nevada operations, 211 employees in Canada at its Golden Giant operations, 2,727 employees in Indonesia at its Batu Hijau operations, 41 employees in New Zealand at its Martha operation, 325 employees in Bolivia at its Kori Kollo operation, 628 employees at its Australia operations, and 552 employees in Peru at its Yanacocha operation, working under a collective bargaining agreement or similar labor agreement. Currently there are labor agreements in effect for all of these workers. Our Earnings Could Be Affected by the Prices of Other Commodities The earnings of Newmont also could be affected by the prices of other commodities such as fuel and other consumable items, although to a lesser extent than by the price of gold or copper. The prices of these commodities are affected by numerous factors beyond Newmont s control. Title to Some of Our Properties May Be Defective or Challenged Although we have conducted title reviews of our properties, title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title. While Newmont believes that it has satisfactory title to its properties, some risk exists that some titles may be defective or subject to challenge. In addition, certain of our Australian properties could be subject to native title or traditional landowner claims, but such claims would not deprive us of the properties. For information regarding native title or traditional landowner claims, see the discussion under the Australia section of Item 2, Properties, below. 14
Table of Contents
We Compete With Other Mining Companies We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives and other employees with technical skills and experience in the mining industry. We also compete with other mining companies for rights to mine properties containing gold and other minerals. There can be no assurance that Newmont will continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties. Certain Factors Outside of Our Control May Affect Our Ability to Support the Carrying Value of Goodwill At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of our goodwill was approximately 3.0 billion or 24 of our total assets. Such goodwill has been assigned to our Merchant Banking 1.6 billion) and Exploration 1.1 billion) Segments, and to various mine site reporting units 0.3 billion in the aggregate). This goodwill arose in connection with our February 2002 acquisitions of Normandy and Franco-Nevada, and it represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of Normandy and Franco-Nevada. We evaluate, on at least an annual basis, the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether current events and circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may no longer be recoverable. This evaluation involves a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Based on valuations of the Merchant Banking and Exploration Segments, the Company concluded that the fair values significantly exceeded the respective carrying values as of December 31, 2004. The fair values of the reporting units are based in part on certain factors that may be partially or completely outside of our control, such as the investing environment, the discovery of proven and probable reserves, commodity prices and other factors. In addition, certain of the assumptions underlying the December 31, 2004 Merchant Banking and Exploration valuations may not be easily achieved by the Company, even though such assumptions were based on historical experience and the Company considers such assumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances. At December 31, 2004, the 1.6 billion carrying value of the Merchant Banking Segment goodwill represented approximately 65 of the carrying value of the total assets of the Merchant Banking Segment. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the equity portfolio sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9 ; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) pre-tax returns on investment ranging from 35 starting in 2005 and gradually declining to 15 in 2012 through 2014; (iv) an initial equity portfolio investment of approximately 0.5 billion; (v) capital infusions of 50 million annually for the next three years; and (vi) a terminal value of approximately 2.2 billion. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the royalty portfolio sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9 ; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; (iii) an annual growth rate of 5 in the royalty portfolio; and (iv) a pre-tax rate of return on investment of 13 . The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the portfolio management sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9 ; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax advisory fee of 5 on approximately 0.5 billion of transactions and value-added activities in 2005, with the dollar amount of such transactions and activities increasing by 5 annually thereafter. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis for the value realization sub-segment of the Merchant Banking Segment assumed: (i) a discount rate of 9 ; (ii) a time horizon of ten years; and (iii) a pre-tax annual return on investments of 4.2 million. The December 31, 2004 discounted cash flow analysis assumed a combined terminal value for the royalty portfolio, portfolio management and downstream gold refining sub-segments of approximately 0.7 billion. At December 31, 2004, the 1.1 billion carrying value of the Exploration Segment goodwill represented approximately 98 of the carrying value of the total assets of the Exploration Segment. Based on the review of historical additions to proven and probable reserves and on management s expectation of the growth rate and levels of reserve additions that could be expected to continue in the future, the discounted cash flow model developed to value the Exploration Segment at December 31, 2004 assumed that (i) the Exploration Segment
Table of Contents
would be responsible for 11.0 million ounces of additions to proven and probable reserves in 2005; (ii) such additions would increase by 5 annually; and (iii) approximately 9.1 , 8.7 , 8.3 and 7.9 of additions in years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, would represent ounces that had previously been valued in the Normandy purchase accounting. In addition, the discounted cash flow model for the Exploration Segment assumed, among other matters: (i) a 16-year time horizon, including a seven-year time lapse between additions to proven and probable reserves and the initiation of production and a five-year production period; (ii) a discount rate of 8 ; (iii) a terminal value of approximately 5.8 billion; (iv) an average gold price of 375 per ounce during the time horizon; (v) total cash costs per ounce of 230; and (vi) capital costs of 50 per ounce. The Company believes that any model used to value the Exploration Segment will need to take into account the relatively long time horizon required to evaluate the activities of the Exploration Segment. In the absence of any mitigating valuation factors, the Company s failure to achieve one or more of the December 31, 2004 valuation assumptions will over time result in an impairment charge. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that significant non-cash impairment charges will not be recorded in the future due to possible declines in the fair values of our reporting units. For a more detailed description of the estimates and assumptions involved in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies, below. Our Ability to Recognize the Benefits of Deferred Tax Assets is Dependant on Future Cash Flows and Taxable Income The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the deferred tax assets recorded at the balance date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could limit the Company s ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by its deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2004, the Company recorded 173.6 million and 491.7 million of current and long-term deferred tax assets, respectively.

Item 1 -- Risk Factors).
Interest-Rate Risk Management
At December 31, 2004, certain of our short-term investments were subject to changes in market interest rates and were sensitive to those changes. We currently have no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes. We may choose to use derivative instruments in the future, such as interest rate swaps, to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes.
The following table presents principal cash flows (in thousands) for short-term investments sensitive to changes in market interest rates at December 31, 2004, by maturity date and the related average interest rate. The variable rates are estimated based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

Commodity-Price Risk Management
At times, we use commodity forward sales commitments, commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce. Contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production. We use these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures. We are exposed to certain losses, generally the amount by which the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity, in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these agreements. The instruments held by us are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading. All contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004, are required to be accounted for as derivatives under SFAS No. 133.
The following table provides information about our forward sales contracts at December 31, 2004. The table presents the notional amount in tonnes, the average forward sales price and the total-dollar contract amount expected by the maturity dates, which occur during 2005.

Risk Factors
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the market price of the common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy such common stock. Also consider carefully the statements under the heading Note on Forward-Looking Information below. You should be prepared to accept the occurrence of any and all of the risks associated with purchasing our common stock, including a loss of all of your investment.
Risks related to Our Business

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
We have a history of operating losses and a significant accumulated deficit, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
We have not been profitable since our inception in January 1991. As of December 31, 2004, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 157 million. We expect to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as a result of a high level of operating expenses, significant up-front expenditures, production and marketing activities and very limited revenue from our core business. We may never realize significant revenues from our core business or be profitable. Factors that will influence the timing and amount of our profitability include:
market acceptance of the PHD System;
our success in commercializing the PHD System, which will be difficult to achieve;
our ability to effectively and efficiently manufacture, market and distribute the PHD System; and
our ability to sell or rent the PHD System and related services at a price that covers our per unit costs, which result may be difficult to achieve, in part because of the significant restrictions on the reimbursement of dialysis treatment by the Medicare program, as discussed below, and the high cost of manufacturing the PHD System.
We face significant challenges in shifting from the development stage to the commercialization stage for the PHD System. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in such a transition, and there can be no assurance that we will have any significant revenues or that we will ever achieve profitable operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
Our cost to produce the PHD System and deliver related services and supplies currently exceeds the market price of the PHD System and related services and supplies.
The pricing of the PHD System and related services and supplies is constrained by limitations on governmental and third party reimbursement programs. Although a team of our engineering personnel is currently implementing plans to reduce costs through redesign of PHD subsystems and we are attempting to source alternative materials and suppliers, there can be no assurance that these efforts will enable us to achieve profitable operations.
In addition, the cost of services and supplies for the PHD System currently exceeds the market price as a result of the need to have a local presence of field service and clinical service personnel in each geographical area that PHD Systems are sold. Although we anticipate that as more PHD units are placed in these geographical areas the per unit cost of services and supplies will decrease, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing a sufficient number of PHD units in the field to achieve these per unit cost reductions. Furthermore, the PHD System is comprised of new, complex, highly automated technologies, which operate in a rigorous process. While we continue to realize improvements in the PHD System s reliability as a result of the acquisition and development of new parts and subsystems, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reaching industry norms for reliability. If we are unable to improve the reliability of the PHD System, our operating costs will be adversely impacted and we may not achieve profitability as a result.
If a PHD is unavailable for treatments for more than a few days, the patient assigned to the machine must go back to his dialysis clinic for in-center treatment until his PHD is repaired. Although we have experienced infrequent incidents of patients on the PHD System needing to go back in center for treatments to date, we cannot assure you, based on our limited experience, that such incidents will not occur more frequently in the future.
Our business will fail if we cannot successfully commercialize the PHD System; because we have only recently begun this commercialization process, our success cannot be predicted and is uncertain. Our success is dependent on many variables entirely outside of our control.
Acceptance of the PHD System in the marketplace by both potential users and purchasers (two separate groups with at times conflicting interests) is uncertain, and failure to achieve sufficient market acceptance will significantly limit our ability to generate revenue and become profitable. The success of the PHD System is dependent on many variables, including its safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness as an alternative dialysis modality. The failure to conclusively demonstrate each of these factors could significantly hinder market acceptance of our PHD System, and the failure of our PHD System to achieve sustained commercial viability or market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on us and your investment in Aksys. Moreover, successful commercialization will depend upon, among other things, market acceptance of the efficacy of daily hemodialysis. This will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds by us to inform nephrologists, dialysis clinics, other healthcare providers and dialysis patients of the benefits of daily hemodialysis, and thus the benefits of the PHD System.
In marketing the PHD system, we may encounter significant clinical and market resistance to:
using the PHD System;
home hemodialysis, which is currently employed by only a small percentage of patients suffering from end-stage renal disease; and
daily hemodialysis, which to our knowledge has never been a widely accepted dialysis alternative.
There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the PHD System will ever achieve market acceptance. In addition, the PHD System is a personal system, designed for use by a single patient, and requires several hours after a dialysis treatment to prepare itself for the next treatment session. As such, it is very unlikely to
be used in the prevailing method of outpatient hemodialysis, which generally involves treating patients three times per week for treatment sessions lasting between three and four hours. In this prevailing method of hemodialysis, patients receiving treatment on a given day are treated in shifts, with patients on succeeding shifts using dialysis machines employed during prior shifts.
A number of other factors will affect the future success and sales of our product. These factors include:
the amount of government and private reimbursement for dialysis treatment;
whether the system will be safe or effective or that it will be cost-effective relative to other dialysis treatment alternatives;
whether daily hemodialysis will be shown to be more clinically effective than alternative dialysis modalities;
whether patients will be reluctant to administer and monitor the PHD System with limited or no supervision; and
whether there are unexpected side effects, complications or other safety issues associated with daily hemodialysis (or the PHD System) that may adversely affect the market for our products and services.

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
We are entirely dependent on the PHD System, our sole product.
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development of the PHD System. We expect to be entirely dependent for the foreseeable future on sales of, and services relating to, the PHD System for revenues. Our dependence on a single product creates significant risk for our company and stockholders.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
Uncertainty and amount of third-party reimbursement could affect our profitability.
Although most private insurance policies cover a substantial portion of the cost of dialysis treatment in the United States, most patients receiving dialysis treatment in the United States are insured by Medicare or Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid provide reimbursement for dialysis treatment at set composite rates, which have not increased significantly since 1983. There can be no assurance that the current limitations or requirements on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for dialysis will not have a materially adverse effect on the market for the PHD System, that health administration authorities outside of the United States will provide reimbursement at acceptable levels or at all or that current or future reimbursement rates will be sufficient to enable us to maintain prices at levels sufficient to become profitable.

---------- Risk Chunk 6 ----------
Competitors and technological advances could cause us to lose current and future business opportunities and materially harm our results of operations and ability to grow.
The dialysis industry is characterized by competition for financing, executive talent, intellectual property and product sales. Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial, scientific and technical resources, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources, technical and service networks and experience than us, and greater experience in developing products, providing services and obtaining regulatory approvals. If our competitors succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or less costly than the PHD System, our sales as well as our prospects for achieving profitability may be adversely impacted. We also expect that the number of our competitors and potential competitors will increase. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any existing or potential competitors.
In order to compete effectively, we will need, among other things, to demonstrate the clinical and cost effectiveness of daily home hemodialysis using the PHD System. Our ability to successfully market our products and services could be adversely impacted by pharmacological and technological advances in preventing the progression of ESRD in patients (such as those with diabetes and hypertension), technological developments by others, development of new medications designed to reduce the incidence of kidney transplant rejection and progress in using kidneys harvested from genetically-engineered animals as a source of transplants.

---------- Risk Chunk 7 ----------
If we cannot develop adequate distribution, customer service and technical support networks, we may not be able to market and distribute our PHD System effectively.
Our strategy involves contracting with dialysis providers to have us supply to dialysis patients the PHD System, dialysate and other consumables, patient training, customer service and maintenance and other technical service. To provide these services, we must develop networks of employees or independent contractors in each of the areas in which we intend to operate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to organize these networks on a cost-effective basis. The failure to establish these networks on a cost-effective basis would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 8 ----------
Our future sales could be adversely affected due to our limited marketing experience.
We currently market our products and services primarily through our own sales force. We have limited experience in sales, marketing and distribution. There can be no assurance that we will be able to build an adequate marketing staff or sales force or that the cost of such will not be prohibitive, or that our direct sales and marketing efforts will be successful.

---------- Risk Chunk 9 ----------
We are subject to extensive government regulation, which can be costly, time consuming and subject us to unanticipated interruptions or delays in our commercial operations.
The PHD System, our sole product, is subject to stringent government regulation in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the PHD System is regulated as a medical device by the FDA. In March 2002, we announced receipt of clearance from the FDA to market the PHD System in the United States. The FDA clearance had no restrictions and included authorization to use the product in the home; however, FDA clearance under 510(k) is subject to continual review and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on product marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market.
In the European Economic Area, the PHD System is regulated as a medical device under the Medical Device Directive. In October 2002, we announced receipt of EC Certification for CE Mark approval pursuant to the Medical Device Directive. The certification approved the PHD System for home use. Such approval was required prior to the commercialization of the PHD System in the European Economic Area.
Additional government regulations may be established or imposed in the United States or the European Economic Area, or the interpretation or enforcement of such regulations may change, which could materially impact the regulatory clearances we have received for the PHD System and its continued commercialization.
In addition, various statutes and regulations also govern the testing, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products, which present significant compliance burdens for our company. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in fines, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances, refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices and criminal prosecution.
The manufacture of the PHD System must also comply or ensure compliance with current QSR regulations promulgated by the FDA. We may be required to expend time, resources and effort in product manufacturing and quality control to ensure compliance even though our PHD System is manufactured currently by an independent contractor. If violations of the applicable regulations are noted during FDA inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may have a materially adverse effect on the continued marketing of our products.
You should also be aware that proper regulatory approvals have not been completed in any jurisdictions other than the United States and the European Economic Area. There can be no assurance or guarantee that any of these approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all.
We rely on independent contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our PHD System. Our inability to manufacture the PHD System, and our dependence on independent contractors, may delay or impair our ability to generate revenues, or adversely affect our profitability.
To be successful, our PHD System must be manufactured in commercial quantities and at acceptable cost. Production of this product, especially in commercial quantities, will create technical as well as financial challenges for us. We may encounter unexpected delays or costs in the scale-up of manufacturing operations. Further, manufacturing or quality control problems may arise (and among other things increase our costs) as we increase production of the PHD System or as additional manufacturing capacity is required in the future.
We currently rely on single contract manufacturers to manufacture each of the major components of the PHD System. Such contractors are not employed or otherwise controlled by us and are generally free to conduct their business at their own discretion. Although certain of our contract manufacturers have entered into contracts with us to manufacture components of the PHD System, such contracts can be terminated at any time under certain circumstances by us or by the contractors, and can be breached at any time. Further, work stoppages and the slowing of production at a single independent contractor would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.
There are also other risks inherent in using single sources of supply. We have not made alternative arrangements for the manufacture of the major components of the PHD System and we may not be able to implement acceptable alternative arrangements on a timely basis, or at all. It is likely that a significant interruption in supply would result if we utilize or were required to utilize a different manufacturing contractor for any of the major components of the PHD System. The loss of the services of any of our contract manufacturers would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we or our manufacturers may not be able to obtain, on a timely basis, components or other supplies necessary to manufacture or use the PHD System.

---------- Risk Chunk 10 ----------
We will need additional capital in the future which, if not available to us, may alter our business plans or limit our ability to achieve growth and which, if raised, will dilute your ownership interest in us.
Our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. Prior to the payments we received in February and May 2004 in connection with the Durus settlement, we have been dependent primarily on the net proceeds of public and private sales of our equity securities. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Financing Activities. Our proceeds to date from equity offerings are approximately 152 million. We currently have no committed sources of, or other arrangements with respect to, additional financing. We do not believe that our existing capital resources, together with future operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund our future operations through 2006. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including without limitation:
manufacturing scale-up and associated costs;
costs associated with establishing marketing, distribution, patient training and technical and patient support networks;
continued progress in research and development; and
the costs involved in protecting our proprietary rights.
During 2005, we expect that approximately 30 to 32 million of cash and short and long term investments will be devoted to expanding commercialization of the PHD system. Based on our cash position and short and long term investments as of December 31, 2004, and projected usages in 2005, we currently anticipate that we will seek to raise capital in the latter half of 2005 or early 2006. As discussed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Financing Activities, under the terms of our settlement with the Durus funds, we are prohibited from registering shares of our common stock until May 2005 (or in some instances longer if the Durus funds have commenced an offering of their shares, in which case we may be subject to a lock-up period under our registration rights agreement with the Durus funds). Because the Durus funds continue to own approximately 72 of our common stock and we are still in the early stages of our commercialization efforts, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations beyond
2005. In the event that we are able to raise capital through additional issuances of our equity securities, our then existing stockholders may suffer substantial dilution, and any debt financing we may be able to obtain could result in the imposition of significant financial and operational restrictions on us.

---------- Risk Chunk 11 ----------
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and, as a result, we could lose competitive advantages that could adversely affect our operating results.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain, assert and defend patent rights, protect trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We currently own or have rights to 45 U.S. patents and 28 foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that:
we will be able to obtain additional licenses to patents of others or that we will be able to develop additional patentable technology of our own;
any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that the patents or proprietary rights of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business;
others will not independently develop similar products;
others will not design around or infringe such patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us; and
any patent obtained or licensed by us will be held to be valid and enforceable if challenged by another party.
We are aware that numerous patents have been issued relating to methods of dialysis. Although we endeavor to protect our patent rights from infringement, it is possible that by virtue of the numerous patents that have been, or potentially will be, issued relating to hemodialysis methods, we may not be aware, or become aware, of patents issued to our competitors or others that conflict with our own or those of our licensors. Such conflicts could result in a rejection of important patent applications or the invalidation of important patents, which could have a materially adverse effect on our competitive position. In the event of such conflicts, or in the event we believe that competitive products infringe patents to which we hold rights, we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against, or may be required to defend against such litigation or proceedings involving, holders of such conflicting patents or competing products. Such litigation or proceedings may have a materially adverse effect on our competitive position, and we may not be successful in any such litigation or proceeding. Litigation and other proceedings relating to patent matters, whether initiated by us or a third party, can be expensive and time consuming, regardless of whether the outcome is favorable to us, and can result in the diversion of substantial financial, managerial and other resources. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to cease any related development or commercialization activities. In addition, if patents that contain dominating or conflicting claims have been or are subsequently issued to others and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be required to obtain licenses under patents or other proprietary rights of others. The licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed which may adversely effect our results of operations.
We rely on proprietary know-how and confidential information and employ various methods, such as entering into confidentiality and noncompete agreements with our current employees and with certain third parties to whom we have divulged proprietary information, to protect the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our technologies. Such methods may not afford significant protection to us, and we may not be able to protect adequately our trade secrets or our competitors or other companies may acquire information that we consider proprietary.

---------- Risk Chunk 12 ----------
Product liability claims may reduce demand for the PHD System or result in damages that exceed our insurance coverage.
Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the production, marketing and sale of dialysis products. We currently maintain product liability insurance with a coverage limit of 10 million. Our
insurance policy may not provide adequate protection against potential claims. Furthermore, our agreements with contract manufacturers require us to maintain product liability insurance, and the failure to obtain such insurance could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce our PHD System. A successful claim brought against us in excess of any insurance coverage obtained by us could have a materially adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify certain of our contract manufacturers against certain liabilities resulting from the use of our PHD System.

---------- Risk Chunk 13 ----------
Our business is likely to be hurt if we are unable to keep our senior executive officers and key scientific personnel.
We are dependent upon the services of our senior executives, such as William C. Dow, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and key scientific personnel. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on our senior executives. In addition, we do not have employment agreements, other than certain severance, confidentiality and non-competition agreements, with any of our personnel. Our business would likely be interrupted if we lost the services of Mr. Dow or other senior executives or key employees, which could have a materially adverse effect on operations. Also, our continued commercialization will depend upon, among other things, the successful recruiting and retention of highly skilled managerial and marketing personnel with experience in business activities such as those we contemplate. Competition for the type of highly skilled individuals sought by us is intense, and we may not be able to retain existing employees or find, attract and retain other skilled personnel on acceptable terms.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock

---------- Risk Chunk 14 ----------
The market price of our common stock may be subject to significant volatility.
The price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending upon many factors, including our perceived prospects and those of the dialysis market in general. Since our initial public offering in May 1996, our common stock price has traded between 3.50 and 23.50 per share and we have generally experienced relatively low trading volume in relation to the aggregate number of shares outstanding.
Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price or liquidity of our common stock include:
reports by official or unofficial health or medical authorities, the general media or the FDA regarding the potential benefits or detriments of our PHD System or of similar products distributed by other companies, or of daily or home dialysis;
announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;
events or announcements relating to our relationships with others, including our third party manufacturers;
developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights;
regulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;
economic and other factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and
sales of our common stock by the Durus fund.
External factors may also adversely affect the market price for the common stock. The common stock currently trades on the Nasdaq National Market. The price and liquidity of the common stock may be significantly affected by the overall trading activity and market factors on the Nasdaq National Market.
Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market and the existence of a substantial number of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock could adversely affect market price of the common stock, and also could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities.

---------- Risk Chunk 15 ----------
The resale by the Durus fund of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.
Based on information contained in a Schedule 13D filed by the Durus fund with the SEC on November 19, 2004, we believe the Durus fund owns 21,498,118 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 72 of our outstanding shares. We have filed a registration statement covering these shares and 498,100 shares held by the Artal fund. This registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on May 17, 2004, and enables the Durus fund and the Artal fund to resell their shares in public offerings at their discretion. As a part of the settlement, the Durus fund has agreed that it will reduce its ownership of our common stock over time and that its position in our common stock would be under 15 within two years after the registration statement has become effective, subject to extensions under specified circumstances. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Financing Activities. Although we believe that the Durus fund and the Artal fund will effectuate the sale of their shares in an orderly manner and will seek to obtain the best prices available in connection with any sales, the timing, volume and manner of any sales is within their discretion.
The Durus fund and the Artal fund s sale of their shares may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock due to, among other factors, the selling pressure such sales may cause. Moreover, the perception in the market that a significant portion of our outstanding shares may soon be sold may also have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. These events may cause other holders of our common stock to sell their shares, or it may encourage short sales, all of which could contribute to a decline in the market price of our stock. In addition, these factors may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our equity securities.

---------- Risk Chunk 16 ----------
We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Payment of any future dividends on our common stock will depend upon our earnings and capital requirements, the terms of any indebtedness we incur and other factors our board of directors considers appropriate.

---------- Risk Chunk 17 ----------
We will likely issue additional shares of our common stock and/or preferred stock in the future, which would dilute your voting and ownership percentage.
Certain events over which you have no control could result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, which would dilute your voting and ownership interest in our Company. As of February 28, 2005, there were 29,901,275 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and there were 675,424 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive and stock purchase plans. As of February 28, 2005, there were outstanding options, warrants and other rights to acquire up to approximately 2,986,611 shares of common stock. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:
to raise additional funds for working capital, commercialization, production and marketing activities;
upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options and warrants; and
in lieu of payment of cash dividends.
Under the terms of the registration rights agreement we entered into with the Durus fund and the Artal fund, we may not register shares of our capital stock for our own account or for the account of another third party until May 2005 (or in some instances longer if these shareholders have commenced an offering of their shares, in which case we may be subject to a lock-up period under our own registration rights agreement with them). See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Financing Activities. We anticipate that sometime after this period, we will need to issue shares of capital stock in order to fund our operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 18 ----------
Our charter documents, rights agreement and Section 203 of the DGCL could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.
Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation Charter and Amended and Restated Bylaws Bylaws contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a future takeover or change in control of the Company unless the takeover or change of control is approved by our board of directors. Such provisions may also render the removal of the current board of directors and of management more difficult. These provisions provide for, among other things:
a classified board of directors;
fair price provision, which requires that our stockholders receive equivalent consideration at both stages of a two-step acquisition (such as a tender offer followed by a merger);
a prohibition on stockholder action through written consents;
a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our board of directors or our chief executive officer;
advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;
limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend, alter or repeal our Charter or our Bylaws; and
the authority of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine.
Each outstanding share of our common stock includes one preferred stock purchase right (individually a Right and collectively the Rights as provided under our Rights Agreement. Each Right entitles the holder, until the earlier of October 28, 2006 or the redemption of the Rights, to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A, par value 1.00 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), at a price of 85.00 per one one-thousandth of a share (as may be adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends or certain other dilutive events since the issuance of the Rights). The Series A Preferred Stock is nonredeemable and will have 1,000 votes per share (subject to adjustment). We have reserved 50,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for issuance upon exercise of such Rights. In the event that any person becomes the beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock, the Rights (other than Rights held by the acquiring stockholder) would become exercisable for a number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. Furthermore, if after any person becomes the beneficial owner of 15 or more of our common stock, we are acquired in a merger or other business combination or 50 or more of our assets or earnings power were sold, each Right (other than Rights held by the acquiring person) would become exercisable for that number of shares of common stock (or securities of the surviving company in a business combination) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
One Right will be issued in respect of each share of common stock issued before the earlier of October 28, 2006 or the redemption of the Rights. As of the date hereof, the Rights are not exercisable, certificates representing the Rights have not been issued and the Rights automatically trade with shares of common stock.
The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the board of directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors prior to the time a person has acquired beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the common stock, because until such time the Rights may generally be redeemed by the Company at one cent per Right.

---------- Risk Chunk 19 ----------
As discussed under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Recent Financing Activities, we have amended our Rights Agreement to conditionally exempt the Durus fund and the other defendants therefrom.
We are subject to the business combination statute of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ). In general, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which a person became an interested stockholder, unless:
prior to such date the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder,
upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owns at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned (1) by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer, or
on or subsequent to such date the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66 (2)/ 3 of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.
A business combination includes mergers, stock or asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholders. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years, did own) 15 or more of the voting stock of the subject corporation. Although Section 203 permits us to elect not to be governed by its provisions, we have not made this election. As a result of the application of Section 203, potential acquirors of our company may be discouraged from attempting to effect an acquisition transaction with us, thereby possibly depriving holders of our securities of certain opportunities to sell or otherwise dispose of such securities at above-market prices pursuant to such transactions.
The foregoing summaries do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, our Charter and Bylaws, our Rights Agreement and the DGCL. Copies of our Charter, Bylaws and Rights Agreement are filed as exhibits to filed as exhibits to this report and deemed to be incorporated herein in their entirety.

Item 1 Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements in this Report.
Financing Transactions
In February 2002, we completed an offering of 400 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes at a price of 100 of principal amount. In May 2002, we completed an offering of 150 million aggregate principal amount of additional Senior Notes at a price of 104.5 of principal amount, plus accrued interest from February 2002. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10.25 and mature in 2012.
The net proceeds from the offering completed in February 2002 were 387 million. The net proceeds (excluding accrued interest paid by the purchasers of the Senior Notes) from the offering completed in May 2002 were 151 million. We used all of the net proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and to repay term loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities.
During 2003, we exchanged 55 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, plus accrued interest of 2 million, for approximately 9.9 million shares of our common stock and we purchased 2 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, for 3 million in cash.
In October 2003, we sold an aggregate of 25,300,000 shares of our common stock in a registered public offering at a public offering price of 8.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 190 million, of which 114 million was used to repay term loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities, 56 million was used to reduce the balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility, and the balance was used to repay other short-term debt.
On January 22, 2004, we completed an offering of 225 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures at a price of 100 of principal amount. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately 218 million. We used the net proceeds to repay the remaining 21 million of term loans outstanding under the Senior Facilities, to make provisional payments of 74 million against the fine (the EU antitrust fine that was assessed against us in 2001 by the Directorate General IV of the European Communities (the EU Competition Authority ), and to fund general corporate purposes, including replacement of financing previously provided by factoring of accounts receivable and strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our businesses. The balance was invested in short-term, investment quality, interest-bearing securities or deposits.
In 2004, we exchanged 35 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, plus accrued interest of 1 million, for 3.2 million shares of common stock. Additionally, we purchased 23 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, for 27 million in cash.
On February 8, 2005, we completed a substantial amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement to effect a refinancing of the Revolving Facility. We believe the refinancing has enhanced our stability and liquidity. The Revolving Facility now provides for loans and letters of credit in a maximum amount outstanding at any time of up to 215 million and matures in July 2010. As a result of the refinancing, we have no material debt scheduled to mature prior to July 2010. At the time of the refinancing, no loans were outstanding and approximately 8 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
As amended and restated, the Credit Agreement now provides for, among other things, lower interest rates (reducing spreads by over 112 basis points), less restrictive financial covenants and, subject to certain conditions (including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test), an accordion feature that permits us to establish additional credit facilities thereunder in an aggregate amount, together with the Revolving Facility, of up to 425 million.

---------- Risk Chunk 2 ----------
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding the refinancing of the Revolving Facility.
Litigation Against Our Former Parent Companies Initiated by Us
In February 2000, we commenced a lawsuit against our former parents, Mitsubishi Corporation and Union Carbide Corporation, to recover certain payments made to them in connection with our leveraged equity recapitalization in January 1995 as well as certain unjust receipts by them from their investments in us and damages for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties owed to us by our former senior management in connection with illegal graphite electrode price fixing activities. We are seeking to recover more than 1.5 billion, including interest. On January 27, 2004, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the SDNY District Court granted the defendants motions to dismiss the lawsuits. We appealed this decision to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals (the Circuit Court of Appeals ), which affirmed the dismissal. We have sought a rehearing before the Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect to incur 10 million to 20 million for legal expenses to pursue this lawsuit from the date of filing the complaint through appeal and ultimately trial. Through December 31, 2004, we had incurred about 7 million of these legal expenses. This lawsuit is in its earliest stages, and the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit is subject to many uncertainties.
Antitrust Litigation Against Us
Since 1997, we and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products have been subject to antitrust investigations by antitrust authorities in the U.S., the European Union, Canada, Japan and Korea. In addition, civil antitrust lawsuits have been commenced and threatened against us and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.
In April 1998, GTI pled guilty to a one count charge of violating U.S. federal antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes and was sentenced to pay a non-interest-bearing fine in the aggregate amount of 110 million, payable in six annual installments. The payment schedule has been revised periodically at our request. As of December 31, 2004, 67 million has been paid on the DOJ antitrust fine (including imputed interest of 20 million). The payment schedule for the remaining 43 million balance consists of quarterly installments ranging from 3.25 million to 5.375 million, payable through January 2007. Beginning in 2004, the DOJ may ask the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the District Court to accelerate the payment schedule based on a change in our ability to make such payments. Interest began to accrue on the unpaid balance, commencing in April 2004, at the statutory interest rate of 1.50 per annum. Accrued interest is payable together with each quarterly payment.
In July 2001, the EU Competition Authority assessed a fine of 50.4 million against us for violating antitrust laws of the European Community and the European Economic Area in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes. After an in-depth analysis of the decision, in October 2001, we filed an appeal challenging, among other things, the amount of the EU antitrust fine, including the accrual of interest and the rate thereof. In February and April 2004, we posted 71 million and 3 million, respectively, with the EU Competition Authority as a provisional payment against the EU antitrust fine and accrued interest at a rate of 8.04 per annum.
On April 29, 2004, the EU antitrust fine was reduced on appeal to 42 million, plus accrued interest of 7.7 million (at a rate of 8.04 per annum), an aggregate of about 59 million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on the appeal was issued. As a result of this reduction, in June 2004, we received a refund of 10 million 12 million based on currency exchange rates then in effect) from the EU Competition Authority.
Except as described above, the antitrust investigations against us in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Japan and Korea with respect to graphite electrodes and in the European Union with respect to isostatic and extruded specialty graphite have been finally resolved. It is possible that antitrust investigations seeking, among other things, to impose fines and penalties could be initiated against us by antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions.
We have settled, among other things, virtually all of the actual and potential claims against us by customers in the U.S. and Canada arising out of alleged antitrust violations occurring prior to the date of the relevant settlement in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes, carbon electrodes and bulk graphite products. All settlement payments due have been timely paid. None of the settlements or plea agreements contain restrictions on future prices of our graphite electrodes or other products. There remain, however, certain pending claims as well as pending lawsuits in the U.S. relating to the sale of graphite electrodes sold to foreign customers. It is also possible that additional antitrust lawsuits and claims could be asserted against us in the U.S. or other jurisdictions.
Since 1997, we have recorded pretax charges of 383 million against results of operations as a reserve for potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims. The charges of 383 million are calculated on a basis that (i) excludes, among other things, both actual and imputed interest on the DOJ antitrust fine and (ii) includes, among other things, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on the euro-denominated EU antitrust fine and interest accrued on the EU antitrust fine. Interest on the DOJ antitrust fine (including interest that, for accounting purposes, is imputed on the DOJ antitrust fine for the period during which it was non-interest bearing) is recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

---------- Risk Chunk 3 ----------
To the extent that aggregate liabilities and expenses, net, are known or reasonably estimable, as of December 31, 2004, 383 million represents our estimate of these liabilities and expenses.
Through December 31, 2004, we paid an aggregate of 360 million of fines and net settlements and expenses (of which 340 million has been applied against the reserve and 20 million of imputed interest has not been applied against the reserve). In the aggregate, the fines and net settlements and expenses are within the amounts we used to evaluate the aggregate charges of 383 million. Our insurance has not and will not materially cover liabilities that have or may become due in connection with antitrust investigations or related lawsuits or claims.
At December 31, 2003 and 2004, 125 million and 43 million remained in the reserve, respectively. At December 31, 2004, the reserve was unfunded and was available primarily for the remaining scheduled DOJ antitrust fine payments.
Actual aggregate liabilities and expenses (including settled investigations, lawsuits and claims, as well as pending appeals and unsettled pending, threatened and possible lawsuits and claims mentioned above) could be materially higher than 383 million and the timing of payment thereof could be sooner than anticipated.
Customer Base
We are a global company and serve all major geographic markets. Sales of our products to customers outside the U.S. accounted for about 71 of our net sales in 2002, 76 of our net sales in 2003 and 76 of our net sales in 2004. Our customer base includes both steel and non-steel producers. In 2004, three of our ten largest customers were purchasers of non-graphite electrode products. In 2004, five of our ten largest customers were based in Europe, two were in the U.S. and one was in each of Canada, Mexico and Brazil. No single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than 5 of our net sales in 2004.
Results of Operations
Financial information discussed below omits our non-strategic composite tooling business that was sold in June 2003 and has been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of our discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations.
2004 Compared to 2003
Net sales of 848 million in 2004 represented a 136 million, or 19 , increase from net sales of 712 million in 2003 primarily due to higher net sales in our synthetic graphite line of business. Cost of sales of 638 million in 2004 represented a 94 million, or 17 , increase from cost of sales of 544 million in 2003, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Gross profit of 210 million in 2004 represented a 42 million, or 25 , increase from gross profit of 168 million in 2003. Gross margin increased to 24.7 of net sales in 2004 from 23.6 of net sales in 2003. See below for further details regarding such changes.
Synthetic Graphite Segment. Net sales of 751 million in 2004 represented a 112 million, or 18 , increase from net sales of 639 million in 2003, primarily due to higher sales volume of graphite electrodes and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton.
Volume of graphite electrodes sold was 222,000 metric tons in 2004 as compared to 200,500 metric tons in 2003. The higher volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase of 51 million in net sales. Average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in 2004 was 2,515 as compared to 2,344 in 2003. The higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of 48 million in net sales, approximately one-third of which was due to the positive impact of net changes in currency exchange rates. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of 8 million due primarily to changes in product and geographical mix.
The remaining 21 million increase in net sales in the synthetic graphite segment occurred almost equally within advanced synthetic graphite products and cathode and related products. Advanced synthetic graphite product sales increased primarily due to the strengthening in the semiconductor, electronics, energy and transportation markets. Higher
volumes of products sold increased net sales by 5 million while improved pricing increased net sales by 2 million. Remaining increases were due to net favorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes. Cathodes and related product net sales increased primarily due to 9 million of net favorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes and 7 million due to a favorable change in product mix, offset by negative pricing impacts.
Cost of sales of 564 million in 2004 represented a 76 million, or 16 , increase from cost of sales of 488 million in 2003. 60 million of the increase related to graphite electrodes. In the case of graphite electrodes, increased costs of 39 million due to increased volumes, 18 million due to the negative impact of net changes in currency exchange rates on costs and 16 million due to continued upward pressure on energy, raw material costs (particularly petroleum-based raw materials) and freight were partially offset by 9 million of improvements of productivity throughout our manufacturing network and 4 million of other cost reductions. Additionally, cost of sales increased for cathodes and related products by 14 million. Net unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rate changes increased costs by 7 million, changes in volumes and product mix increased costs by 4 million and other higher costs amounted to 3 million. The remaining 2 million represents higher cost of sales for our advanced synthetic graphite products, primarily due to higher volumes.
As a result, gross profit in 2004 was 187 million, 23 or 36 million higher than in 2003. Gross margin was 24.8 of net sales in 2004, while gross margin was 23.7 of net sales in 2003.
Other Segment. Net sales of 97 million in 2004 represented a 24 million, or 31 , increase from net sales of 73 million in 2003. Higher sales volumes of carbon refractory products resulted in an increase of 14 million while higher electronic thermal management sales resulted in an increase of 10 million.
Cost of sales of 74 million in 2004 represented a 18 million, or 30 , increase from cost of sales of 56 million in 2003. The increase in cost of sales occurred primarily within our advanced carbon materials line of business, which increased 13 million primarily due to higher sales volumes of carbon refractory products and upward pressure on energy and raw material costs. Remaining increases were primarily due to increased electronic thermal management sales.
As a result, gross profit in 2004 was 23 million, 35 or 6 million higher than in 2003. Gross margin was 23.8 of net sales in 2004, while gross margin was 23.1 of net sales in 2003.
Items Affecting Us as a Whole. Selling, administrative and other expenses increased 5 million from 85 million in 2003 to 90 million in 2004. The increase was due to investments to improve global business processes, primarily new global information systems and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts. These changes in business processes resulted in higher costs of 5 million. In addition, we incurred higher selling expenses of 3 million in 2004 as a result of higher sales revenue. The net unfavorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates increased costs by 2 million and various other cost increases amounted to 3 million. These higher costs were partially offset by 8 million of lower employee benefit costs consisting
primarily of lower variable compensation expenses, and to a lesser extent, lower post retirement expense.
Research and development expenses decreased 3 million from 11 million in 2003 to 8 million in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to both higher benefits from external funding proceeds from grants awarded to us in 2004 by the State of Ohio to support fuel cell development programs and lower net costs due to our 2003 voluntary severance programs and workforce attrition. These personnel reductions are net of increases in research and development resources dedicated to electronic thermal management development activities.
Other (income) expense, net, was expense of 21 million in 2004 and consisted primarily of a 9 million loss attributable to a reduction of Senior Notes outstanding (due to debt for equity exchanges and repurchases), 9 million in legal, environmental and other related costs, 4 million of fair value adjustment on interest rate caps, 3 million of bank fees and other financing fees, 3 million of non-income taxes and 7 million of other costs. Such costs were partially offset by other income of 8 million of currency exchange gains, primarily associated with euro-denominated intercompany loans, 3 million of gains on the sale of assets, the majority of which pertained to a gain on the sale of our fixed assets in connection with the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in Sheffield, United Kingdom, and 3 million in other benefits.
Other (income) expense, net, was income of 12 million in 2003, primarily due to currency exchange benefits of 35 million, primarily associated with euro-denominated intercompany loans. These benefits were partially offset by other expenses, including 5 million for bank and other financing fees, 3 million in legal, environmental and other related costs, a 4 million of a write down of assets, 4 million for employee benefit curtailment and other costs, 3 million for non-income taxes in Brazil and Switzerland, 2 million associated with the write-off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs, and 2 million in other costs.
In 2004, we recorded a nominal net restructuring benefit. This consisted primarily of a 1 million charge related to severance programs and related benefits associated with the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in Sheffield, United Kingdom, and a 1 million charge associated with changes in estimates related to U.S. voluntary and selective severance programs, offset by a 2 million benefit in connection with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in Caserta, Italy (consisting of a 5 million reduction in cost estimates, occurring primarily in the synthetic graphite line of business, partially offset by a 3 million charge related primarily to the completion of further severance agreements for employees terminated in connection with the closure). It is also possible that we may, at any time, decide to permanently shut down our remaining graphite electrode operations in Italy. In such event, we may record additional restructuring charges and incur additional exit costs.
The following table summarizes activity relating to the accrued expense in connection with the restructuring charges. The restructuring accrual is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The components of this balance consist primarily of 4 million related to the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in Caserta, Italy, 2 million related primarily to remaining lease payments on our former corporate headquarters, 2 million related to the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in Welland, Canada and 1 million related to the closure of our advanced graphite machining operations in Sheffield, United Kingdom. We expect to make 6 million of these payments by the end of 2005 with the majority of the remaining payments to be paid by the end of 2007.
Restructuring charges were 20 million in 2003 and consisted of 9 million for organizational changes and 11 million for the closure and settlement of our U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan for the participating salaried workforce. The 9 million charge for organizational changes related to U.S. voluntary and selective severance programs and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of 103 employees. The closure of our non-qualified U.S. defined benefit plan resulted in recognition of net actuarial losses of 11 million.
In 2003, we recorded a 5 million impairment loss on long-lived and other assets relating to the remaining fixed assets in connection with the closure of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in Caserta, Italy. In 2003, we sold land in Clarksville, Tennessee and received net proceeds of 2 million. We recorded a 2 million net write off of the remaining book value of assets in Clarksville, Tennessee.
We recorded a 1 million charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims in the 2004 first quarter. This charge was offset by a gain due to the refund of 10 million 12 million based on currency
exchange rates then in effect) that we received from the EU Competition Authority as a result of the reduction of the EU antitrust fine to 42 million, plus accrued interest of a 7.7 million (which was calculated at a rate of 8.04 per annum), an aggregate of about 59 million at currency exchange rates in effect at the time the decision on our appeal thereof was issued.

---------- Risk Chunk 4 ----------
We recorded a 32 million charge in the 2003 fourth quarter relating to the EU antitrust fine.

Average total debt outstanding was 676 million in 2004 as compared to 697 million in 2003. The average annual interest rate was 5.5 in 2004 as compared to 7.1 in 2003. These average annual rates include the benefits of our interest rate swaps, but exclude imputed interest on the DOJ antitrust fine, the amortization of the effective discount on the debentures, the amortization of the net proceeds from the sale of swaps and the acceleration of the amortization of gains realized from the sale of interest rate swaps due to the early extinguishment of debt from our exchange of common stock for, and repurchases of, Senior Notes outstanding.

---------- Risk Chunk 5 ----------
We recorded interest income in 2004 of 1 million primarily attributable to interest earned on cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Debentures.
Provision for income taxes was a charge of 46 million in 2004 as compared to a charge of 5 million in 2003. The effective income tax rate was 72 in 2004. The higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of a standard tax election (the 2004 special tax election that accelerated approximately 207 million of taxable income in the U.S. that resulted in the utilization of approximately 28 million in deferred tax assets, of which approximately 21 million were existing foreign tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. This resulted in tax expense that was 28 million higher in 2004 than if we had not made this election. The effective rate in 2004 was also impacted by a benefit from the EU Competition Authority refund, which was non-taxable in the U.S., and by nondeductible expenses associated with certain restructuring charges. The effective income tax rate was not meaningful in 2003 because we incurred income tax expense of 5 million, even though we recognized a loss from continuing operations of 20 million, primarily due to tax expense of 8 million associated with nondeductible antitrust related charges and an additional 5 million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The effective income tax rate was 36 in 2004 and
40 in 2003, in each case excluding the impact of restructuring charges, antitrust charges or benefits, and the tax expense resulting from the 2004 special tax election.
The American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (the " Jobs Act ") could provide a future benefit of lowering the effective U.S. tax rate on certain qualifying U.S. manufacturing production activities. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of any potential benefit from the Jobs Act.
During 2003, we recorded a 1 million gain from the sale of our non-strategic composite tooling business. The discontinued business recorded a net income from operations of 1 million in 2003.
2003 Compared to 2002. Net sales of 712 million in 2003 represented a 116 million, or 20 , increase from net sales of 596 million in 2002. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher net sales in our synthetic graphite and advanced carbon materials lines of business. Cost of sales of 544 million in 2003 represented an 83 million, or 18 , increase from cost of sales of 461 million in 2002. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher sales volumes. Gross profit of 168 million in 2003 represented a 24 increase from gross profit of 135 million in 2002. Gross margin increased to 23.6 of net sales in 2003 from 22.7 in 2002.
Synthetic Graphite Segment. Net sales of 639 million in 2003 represented a 101 million, or 18 , increase from net sales of 538 million in 2002, primarily due to higher sales volume of graphite electrodes and higher average graphite electrode sales revenue per metric ton. Volume of graphite electrodes sold was 200,500 metric tons in 2003 as compared to 180,500 metric tons in 2002. The higher volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase of 42 million in net sales. The increase was a result of stronger demand for graphite electrodes primarily in the United States and Europe. Average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes in 2003 was 2,344 as compared to the average in 2002 of 2,100. The higher average sales revenue per metric ton represented an increase of 49 million in net sales. The increase was primarily due to net changes in currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, increases in graphite electrode prices. Net sales of cathodes increased in 2003 by 4 , or 4 million, from net sales of 90 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to the net positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates, partially offset by lower sales volume and lower average sales price.
Cost of sales of 488 million in 2003 represented a 75 million, or 18 , increase from cost of sales of 413 million in 2002, primarily due to the higher sales volume of graphite electrodes. Gross profit in 2003 was 151 million, 21 or 26 million higher than in 2002. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher graphite electrode net sales and improved productivity from higher operating levels throughout the production network, and the net positive impact of changes in currency exchange rates. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight, energy and other raw materials costs. Gross margin was 23.7 of net sales in 2003, higher than the 23.2 of net sales in 2002.
Other Segment . Net sales of 73 million in 2003 represented a 15 million, or 27 , increase from net sales of 58 million in 2002, primarily due to higher volume of refractories
sold by our advanced carbon materials line of business. Cost of sales of 56 million in 2003 represented an 8 million, or 19 , increase from cost of sales of 48 million in 2002. The increase in cost of sales was primarily related to higher sales volume in our advanced carbon materials line of business, higher energy costs and changes in product mix, partially offset by improved productivity from higher operating levels. Gross profit in 2003 was 17 million (a gross margin of 23.1 of net sales) as compared to gross profit in 2002 of 10 million (a gross margin of 18.5 of net sales).
Items Affecting Us As a Whole. Research and development was 11 million in 2003, a decrease of 2 million from 2002. The decrease was primarily due to cost savings resulting from our voluntary and selective severance programs.
Selling, administrative and other expenses were 85 million in 2003, an increase of 4 million from 2002. In 2003, we recorded higher variable incentive compensation expense and incurred higher costs from continued strengthening of the euro in 2003 and the continued implementation of global work process changes and information systems. These higher costs were partially offset by cost savings from our voluntary and selective severance programs. In addition, in 2002, we benefited from a one-time reduction in franchise and other taxes associated with the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries.
Other (income) expense, net, was income of 12 million in 2003, primarily due to currency exchange benefits of 35 million, which were primarily associated with euro-denominated intercompany loans. These benefits were partially offset by other expenses, including primarily 5 million for bank and other financing fees, 3 million in legal, environmental and other related costs, a 4 million write down of assets, 4 million for employee benefit curtailment and other costs, 3 million for non-income taxes in Brazil and Switzerland, 2 million associated with the write-off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs and 2 million in other costs. Other (income) expense, net, was income of 7 million in 2002, primarily due to currency exchange benefits of 28 million, which were primarily associated with euro-denominated intercompany loans. These benefits were partially offset by other expenses, including primarily 4 million for bank fees and other financing fees, 4 million in legal, environmental and other related costs, 3 million for global realignment, 4 million associated with the write-off of capitalized bank fees and related debt extinguishment costs, 2 million associated with the curtailment of employee benefit plans and other costs and 4 million in various other expenses.
We recorded 20 million of restructuring charges in 2003, consisting of 9 million for organizational changes and 11 million for the closure and settlement of our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit plan for the participating salaried workforce. The 9 million charge for organizational changes related to U.S. voluntary and selective severance programs and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of 103 employees. The closure of our non-qualified U.S. defined benefit plan resulted in recognition of net actuarial losses of 11 million. We recorded 6 million of restructuring charges in 2002. The charges related primarily to the mothballing of graphite electrode manufacturing operations in Italy. This charge included estimated pension, severance and other related employee benefit costs for 102 employees and other costs related to the mothballing. At the end of 2003, we announced the permanent closure of the majority of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in Italy.
We recorded a 5 million impairment loss on long-lived and other assets relating to the remaining fixed assets at our graphite electrode manufacturing facility in Italy in connection with such closure. In 2003, we sold land in Clarksville, Tennessee and received net proceeds of 2 million. We recorded a 2 million net write off of the remaining book value of assets at this site. In 2002, we recorded a 12 million impairment loss on our long-lived carbon electrode assets in Columbia, Tennessee, a 3 million impairment loss on our investment in our venture with Jilin and a 2 million impairment loss on available-for-sale securities.

---------- Risk Chunk 6 ----------
We recorded a 32 million charge in the 2003 fourth quarter relating to the EU antitrust fine.
Interest expense was 45 million in 2003 as compared to 60 million in 2002. Average total debt outstanding was 697 million in 2003 as compared to 701 million in 2002. The average annual interest rate was 7.1 in 2003 as compared to 8.5 in 2002. These average annual rates for 2003 include 13 million of interest rate benefit from our interest rate swaps, but exclude imputed interest on the DOJ antitrust fine, 2 million of amortization of the net proceeds of 30 million with respect to the sale of swaps and a 6 million credit to interest expense from the acceleration of the amortization of gains realized from the sale of interest rate swaps due to the early extinguishment of debt from our exchanges of common stock for, or repurchases of, Senior Notes during 2003.
Provision for income taxes was a charge of 5 million in 2003 as compared to a benefit of 16 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate was not meaningful in 2003 because we incurred income tax expense of 5 million, even though we recognized a loss from continuing operations of 20 million, primarily due to tax expense of 8 million associated with non-deductible antitrust related charges and an additional 5 million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 49 in 2002, 4 million higher than if taxed at the U.S. federal rate, primarily due to higher state tax benefits of 13 million and certain other benefits of 15 million primarily associated with the impact of impairment losses on long-lived and other assets and restructuring charges, partially offset by tax expense of 16 million from adjustments increasing the deferred tax asset valuation allowances and 8 million from the impact of dividends of foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate was 40 in 2003 and about 35 in 2002, in each case excluding the impact of impairment losses on long-lived and other assets, restructuring charges and the charge related to the EU antitrust fine.
During 2003, we recorded a 1 million gain from the sale of our non-strategic composite tooling business. The discontinued business recorded a net income from operations of 1 million in 2003 and 2002.

---------- Risk Chunk 7 ----------
As a result of the changes described above, net loss was 24 million in 2003 as compared to net loss of 18 million in 2002.
Effects of Inflation
We incur costs in the U.S. and each of the six non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility. In general, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition
are affected by the effects of inflation on our costs incurred in each of these countries. See Currency Translation and Transactions for a further discussion of highly inflationary countries.
During the past three years, we experienced higher freight, energy and other raw material costs primarily due to substantial increases in regional and worldwide market prices of natural gas and other petroleum-based raw materials. We seek to mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales through improved operating efficiencies, higher prices for our products and ongoing cost savings, and, in some cases, fixed price or derivative hedging contracts. We have in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, natural gas hedge derivative contracts to effectively fix our direct and indirect natural gas cost exposure in North America (45 of direct worldwide exposure). In addition, we have in the past entered into and may in the future enter into, short duration fixed rate purchase contracts with certain of our natural gas suppliers in order to mitigate seasonal increases in our natural gas costs. We currently do not have any natural gas derivative contracts. Except as described above, we did not experience significant inflation with respect to our costs. We cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not occur or exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts, if any, by which we may be able to increase prices for our products.
Currency Translation and Transactions
We account for our non-U.S. subsidiaries under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Accordingly, except for highly inflationary countries, the assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes. Foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders deficit and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated.
Highly inflationary economies are defined as having cumulative inflation of about 100 or more over a period of three calendar years. In general, the financial statements of foreign operations in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency of their economic environments were the dollar and translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations are included in other (income) expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than as part of stockholders deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have subsidiaries in Russia, Mexico, Brazil and other countries which have had in the past, and may have in the future highly inflationary economies.

---------- Risk Chunk 8 ----------
We account for our Mexican subsidiary using the dollar as its functional currency, regardless of Mexico s inflationary status, because its sales and purchases are predominantly dollar-denominated.

---------- Risk Chunk 9 ----------
We also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other (income) expense, net.
Significant changes in currency exchange rates impacting us are described under Effects of Changes in Currency Exchange Rates and Results of Operations Items Affecting Us as a Whole. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased stockholders deficit by
20 million in 2002 and decreased stockholders deficit by 12 million in 2003 and 22 million in 2004.
Effects of Changes in Currency Exchange Rates
We incur costs in dollars and the currency of each of the six non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility, and we sell our products in multiple currencies. In general, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates affecting these currencies relative to the dollar and, to a limited extent, each other.
When the currencies of non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline (or increase) in value relative to the dollar, this has the effect of reducing (or increasing) the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities. This effect is, however, partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke, a principal raw material used by us, which is priced in dollars. In certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities, and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets, we sell in currencies other than the dollar. Accordingly, when these currencies increase (or decline) in value relative to the dollar, this has the effect of increasing (or reducing) net sales. The result of these effects is to increase (or decrease) operating profit and net income.
Many of the non-U.S. countries in which we have a manufacturing facility have been subject to significant economic changes, which have impacted currency exchange rates. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have net positive or negative impacts on our net sales, cost of sales or net income. We cannot assure you that we would be able to mitigate any adverse effects of such changes.
During 2002, the Brazilian real declined about 35 , the South African rand increased about 38 and the euro increased about 18 relative to the dollar. During 2003, the average exchange rate of the euro and the South African rand increased about 20 and 40 , respectively, when compared to the average exchange rate for 2002. During 2003, the average exchange rate for the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso declined about 1 and 11 , respectively, when compared to the average exchange rate for 2002. During 2004, the average exchange rate of the euro, South African rand, and Brazilian real increased about 10 , 17 and 5 , respectively, when compared to the average exchange rate for 2003. The Mexican peso declined about 5 when compared to the average exchange rate for 2003.
In the case of net sales of graphite electrodes, the impact of these events was a reduction of about 4 million in 2002, an increase of about 33 million in 2003 and an increase of about 18 million in 2004. In the case of cost of sales of graphite electrodes, the impact of these events was a reduction of about 5 million in 2002, an increase of about 24 million in 2003 and an increase of about 18 million in 2004.
We have non-dollar denominated intercompany loans between GrafTech Finance and some of our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of these loans was 477 million (based on currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2004). These loans are subject to remeasurement gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange
rates. A portion of these loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and, as a result, remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders deficit section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance of these loans are deemed to be temporary and, as a result, remeasurement gains and losses on these loans are recorded in other (income) expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2002, we had a net total of 28 million in currency gains, including 45 million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency. In 2003, we had a net total of 35 million in currency gains, including 48 million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency. In 2004, we had a net total of 8 million of currency gains, including 10 million of exchange gains due to the remeasurement of intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency. To manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we use various financial instruments as described under

Item 1A. Risk Factors
8 Item 1A. Risk Factors
There are several factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. Some of these factors, and their impact on the success of our operations and our ability to achieve our goals, are discussed below.
Supplier Risks
Many of our products utilize raw materials or components that are either single or sole sourced. These sources of supply could encounter manufacturing difficulties or may unilaterally decide to stop supplying us because of product liability concerns or other factors. We currently rely on single source suppliers for the silicone and fabric used in our male prostheses and for the porcine dermis and mesh used in many of our female products. Furthermore, we use single sources for the TherMatrx consoles and disposables. A key component of the InhibiZone antibiotic technology is procured from a single source. We mitigate these risks through appropriate inventory levels, defining alternative sources and comprehensive supplier management. The loss of any of these suppliers could have a materially adverse effect on our financial results in the near term, as we would be required to qualify alternate designs or sources.
Potential Product Recalls
In the event that any of our products were defective, we could voluntarily recall, or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) or an international regulatory body could require us to redesign or recall, any defective product. There is a possibility that we may recall products in the future and that future recalls could result in significant costs to us and in significant negative publicity which could harm our ability to market our products in the future.
Continued Physician Use and Endorsement of our Products
For us to sell our products, physicians must recommend and endorse them. We may not obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from physicians. Many of the products we acquired or are developing are based on new treatment methods. Acceptance of our products is dependent on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to competitive products, and on training physicians in the proper application of our products. We believe our products address major market opportunities, but if we are unsuccessful in marketing them, our sales and earnings could be below expectations.
Successful Introduction of New Products and Product Improvements
As part of our growth strategy, we intend to introduce a number of new products and product improvements. If we do not introduce these new products and product improvements on schedule, or they are not well accepted by the market, our growth may be reduced.
Continued Use of Non-Invasive Treatment Alternatives
We predominantly sell devices and kits for invasive or minimally invasive surgical procedures. If patients do not accept our products, our sales may decline. Patient acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including the failure of non-invasive therapies, the degree of invasiveness involved in the procedures using our products, the rate and severity of complications, and other adverse side effects from the procedures using our products. Patients are more likely to first consider non-invasive alternatives to treat their urological disorders. The introduction of new oral medications or other less-invasive therapies could cause our sales to decline.

Actions Related to Reimbursement for Procedures Using our Products
Our physician and hospital customers depend on third party government and non-government entities for reimbursement for services provided to patients. The level of such third party reimbursement may influence whether or not customers purchase our products. Effective January 1, 2004, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) increased reimbursement for certain procedures utilizing inflatable penile prostheses and urinary sphincter devices. This increase partially reversed reductions in such reimbursement rates in 2001 and 2002. Our sales history in the U.S. of these devices does not evidence an obvious correlation with changes in CMS reimbursement rates.
The first quarter of 2004, the American Medical Association approved a CPT code for our Her Option cryoablation system to treat excessive uterine bleeding in the physician s office, which was the first step toward the availability of standard reimbursement for Her Option . In January 2005, CMS published the relative value units to be applied to this therapy, resulting in a national average Medicare allowable payment of 2,602 effective as of January 1, 2005. We do not expect a noticeable effect on sales of Her Option until this data has been incorporated into the reimbursement systems of the individual commercial payers across the country. We can offer no assurances as to the timing or effectiveness the new code and reimbursement level for Her Option procedures will have on the acceptance and practice of this in-office therapy.
Regulatory Approvals and Clinical Results
Regulatory authorities around the world dictate different levels of manufacturing and design information and/or clinical data for various products in order to ensure their safety and efficacy. In the event the data submitted is deemed inadequate or the clinical study results do not support approval, a product may either not be fit for commercialization or may require a redesign.
Intellectual Property Lawsuits
The medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. In the future, we may become a party to lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property. A legal proceeding, regardless of the outcome, would draw upon our financial resources and divert the time and efforts of our management. If we lose one of these proceedings, a court, or a similar foreign governing body, could require us to pay significant damages to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties, require us to redesign our products, or prevent us from manufacturing, using or selling our products. In addition to being costly, protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.
Product Liability Lawsuits
The manufacture and sale of medical devices exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims. In the past, we have had a number of product liability claims relating to our products. In the future, we may be subject to additional product liability claims, some of which may have a negative impact on our business. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could suffer. We are not currently involved in any material product liability litigation.
Costs of Physician Malpractice Insurance
Most of our products are used by physicians who are required to maintain certain levels of medical malpractice insurance to maintain their hospital privileges. As the cost of this insurance increases, certain physicians who have used our products to treat their patients may stop performing surgeries. Unless these patients who would have been treated by these physicians are referred to other physicians, sales of our products will decline.

Acquisition Integration
We have acquired businesses in the past, and we may acquire other businesses in the future. Failure to successfully retain critical employees of an acquired company, failure to gain FDA approval for the products of an acquired company, or the inability to establish and maintain appropriate communications, performance expectations, regulatory compliance procedures, accounting controls, and reporting procedures could have a materially adverse affect on our business. We have integrated TherMatrx into our Minnetonka, Minnesota operations and have obtained FDA approval to transfer the manufacture of certain TherMatrx components to our Minnetonka location.
International Sales
During the fiscal 2004, approximately 20.9 percent of our sales were to customers outside the United States. Some of these sales were to governmental entities and other organizations with extended payment terms. A number of factors, including political or economic instability in the countries where we do business, could affect payment terms and our ability to collect foreign receivables. We have little influence over these factors and changes could have a materially adverse impact on our business. In addition, foreign sales are influenced by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, mainly in the euro. In recent periods, our sales have been positively impacted by increases in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Decreases in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our sales.
Manufacturing Facility
We are currently operating with one manufacturing shift and have adequate physical capacity to serve our business operations for the foreseeable future. We do not have a back up facility, and the loss of our Minnetonka facility would have a materially adverse effect on our sales, earnings, and financial condition.
Ongoing Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
During fiscal 2004, we expended significant resources to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management has concluded the internal controls over financial reporting are adequate and contain no material weaknesses. Furthermore, our 2004 year-end audit resulted in our external auditors ability to attest to our satisfactory assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting with no material weaknesses to report. We realize the requirements of this Act must now be maintained quarterly and are likely to evolve as the result of a reassessment of the Act s initial implementation. Failure to respond to changes in the requirements of the Act or our inability to comply regularly with the Act s requirements could have a materially adverse affect on our business as represented by investor confidence and possible fluctuation in our stock price.
Expensing of Stock Options as Required by SFAS 123(R)
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standard board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment , pursuant to which all stock-based compensation awards must be measured and expensed in consolidated financial statements beginning for us with our third fiscal quarter of 2005. Though we have been including footnote disclosure of the impact of the expense that would be recorded under SFAS No. 123 to our earnings and earnings per share in our regularly published SEC filings, the impact of this change to our stock price, and to those throughout the market, is uncertain at this time.
