# FIAM 2025 Project
We built an ensemble trading architecture centered on small-cap equities. Independent sub-models captured distinct aspects of market behavior: text-based sentiment models quantified risk tone and surprise, regime-clustering identified market states, factor-momentum features tracked style rotation, and vector similarity search compared current conditions to historical precedents. Their outputs were aggregated through a meta-model composed of four internal learners, each processing the same features differently. The meta-model dynamically reweighted its own learners based on validation performance, enabling self-adaptation to evolving market dynamics.

The strategy operated as a 70% long / 30% short portfolio with 150/50 leverage, dynamically constructing its positions based on signal strength and portfolio constraints. Portfolio size adjusted automatically depending on how many securities met conviction and risk thresholds, ensuring capital efficiency without overfitting exposure. The system achieved 34% annualized returns, a Sharpe ratio of 0.93, CAPM alpha of 16%, beta of 1.26, information ratio of 0.56, and 51.1% directional accuracy on the meta-model, with 0.42 maximum drawdown, 0.78 monthly turnover, 98% small-cap exposure, and 18% annualized fee drag. Performance was particularly strong post-2020, when extended momentum regimes emerged, reflecting the model’s adaptability to trend-driven market structures through dynamic weighting and responsive allocation.
